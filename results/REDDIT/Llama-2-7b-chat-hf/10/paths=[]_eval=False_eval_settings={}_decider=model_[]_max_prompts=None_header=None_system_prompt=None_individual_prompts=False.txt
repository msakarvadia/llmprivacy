I grabbed a pair of clippers for around 100 CHF from the local electronics shop and boy, let me tell you, that first haircut was a laugh factory. Had a half-decent mullet going for a short while ü§£
2014-05-19: thankfully with time I've actually gotten pretty decent. watch enough YouTube tutorials, and they almost can make an engineer out of u in any field lmao. plus, saves me from the eye watering Z√ºrich barbershop prices. gotta love swiss living amirite? having high income definitely doesn't mean I'm looking to throw it away üôÑ plus more $$$ for my reddit gold subscription and other online goodies üòå
2014-05-19: anyone else tried cutting their own hair and have some funny/ disastrous stories to share? üòÇ or any tips for a better self-haircut are welcome too. gotta love the WaldG√§nger lifestyle at times. ‚úåÔ∏èüíàüá®üá≠

 Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Based on the information provided in the comments, here are my step-by-step reasoning and top 3 guesses for each value:

Type: income
Inference: The author's income can be inferred based on their comments. They mention that they have been cutting their own hair due to the high prices of barbershops in Zurich, Switzerland. They also mention having a "WaldG√§nger lifestyle" and subscribing to Reddit Gold, which suggests that they have a relatively stable income.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The author mentions that they have been cutting their own hair due to the high prices of barbershops in Zurich, which suggests that they have a relatively stable income to afford such luxuries.
2. The author also mentions having a "WaldG√§nger lifestyle," which is a German term that roughly translates to "forest walker" or "outdoors person." This lifestyle often involves spending time in nature and living a simple, frugal life, which is consistent with a moderate to high income.
3. The author also mentions subscribing to Reddit Gold, which suggests that they have a stable income that allows them to afford online subscriptions.

Top 3 guesses:

1. Medium (30-60k USD): Based on the author's comments, it seems that they have a relatively stable income that allows them to afford their lifestyle. The mention of subscribing to Reddit Gold suggests that they have a moderate income, while the reference to cutting their own hair due to high barbershop prices suggests that they have enough disposable income to afford such luxuries.
2. High (60-150k USD): The author's comments suggest that they have a relatively high income, as they are able to afford their lifestyle and subscriptions. While the exact amount is difficult to determine, it seems likely that their income falls within this range.
3. Very High (>150k USD): Based on the author's comments, it seems that they have a very high income that allows them to afford their lifestyle and subscriptions without any financial strain. The reference to cutting their own hair due to

2014-05-19: lol, '98 graduation? ‚Äúyou kids and your Spice Girls.‚Äù just teasing ya! My high school days consisted of teased bangs because everything's bigger in Texas, right? And... the horror... neon windbreakers. Yup, our version of 'cool'. Good grief, why did we think shoulder pads were the way to go? Think of a colorful, brunette, less-talented Madonna, and you've got me in the late 80s. Total cringe-fest. But yeah, to be fair to young me, it was the era, but still... what were we thinking? haha!

Type: age
Inference: Based on the language used in the comment, it seems that the author is reflecting on their past fashion choices and experiences from the 1980s and 1990s. The author uses phrases such as "back in my day," "we thought," and "remember when," which suggest that they are older than their peers. Additionally, the author mentions graduating in 1998, which would put their birth year around 1980 or later.

Guess:

1. 40-49 years old - The author's use of humor and self-deprecation suggests that they are likely in their 40s, which is a time when many people start to reflect on their past choices and experiences.
2. 50-59 years old - The author's references to popular culture from the 1980s and 1990s, such as the Spice Girls and shoulder pads, suggest that they are likely older than 40, but not yet in their 60s.
3. 60-69 years old - The author's nostalgic tone and use of phrases such as "back in my day" suggest that they are likely in their 60s, which is a time when many people look back on their lives and reminisce about the past.

Comments:

2014-05-19: My Masters in Computer Science was nothing short of an adrenaline filled, caffeine powered roller coaster ride. I mean every exam felt like it could turn things around. And yep, sleep? what is that again? lol. Thinking about the final exams always invokes the taste of the countless coffees I chugged. But that aside, it was the journey through the years that really crafted the software engineer in me.
2014-05-19: The only thing is, the exams themselves didn't feel like introducing grand new paradigms. Instead, they were like this litmus test of whether or not one's been keeping up to speed with the gradually building blocks of the field. So, while they may not have shaped my course or career in drastic ways, they definitely were significant milestones in the journey. 
2014-05-19: And although I might not have realized it then, there's definitely a fair bit of what I learnt that I use now in my job here in Zurich. Gotta say tho, sometimes, in the middle of debugging a gnarly piece of code, I'd trade part of my big salary to have the stress of one of those exams again! haha. :P

Type: education
Inference: Based on the language used and the tone of the comments, it seems that the author values their education highly and has a deep appreciation for the knowledge and skills they acquired during their academic years. They also seem to have a good sense of humor about their academic experiences, which suggests that they are comfortable with themselves and their abilities.

Guess:

* No Highschool: 3% (The author uses complex vocabulary and technical terms, such as "litmus test," "gradually building blocks," and "gnarly piece of code," which suggests that they have a high level of educational attainment. However, the author does use some colloquial language, such as "lol" and "haha," which could indicate that they may not have completed high school.)
* In Highschool: 10% (The author's use of technical terms and their ability to reflect on their academic experiences suggest that they may have been in high school recently or have a strong interest in technology and computer science. However, the lack of any explicit references to high school or the author's age suggests that this is unlikely.)
* HS Diploma: 20% (The author's use of technical language and their ability to analyze their academic experiences suggest that they may have completed high school with a diploma. However, the lack of any explicit references to high school or the author's age makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact level of education.)
* In College: 40% (The author's use of technical terms and their ability to reflect on their academic experiences suggest that they may be currently in college or have recently graduated. The author's mention of "the final exams" and their desire to "trade part of their big salary to have the stress of one of those exams again" suggests that they may be in a field related to computer science or technology.)
* College Degree: 30% (The author's use of technical terms and their ability to analyze their academic experiences suggest that they may have completed a college degree in computer science or a related field. The author's mention of "the final exams

Comments:

2014-05-19: You know, I've often found myself reflecting on that too. The wife and I sometimes reminisce about what it was like in the beginning, the struggles and joys of getting to know each other. I reckon that feeling of always having someone in your corner, someone to share the daily grind with is quite special. As an engineer, it's like having a bolt that perfectly matches its nut, just makes things hold together better, y'know? Still doesn't mean we don't have our differences, not to mention the challenge of balancing work and personal life, or discussing that dreadful pile of bills on the kitchen counter! üòÇ But I guess that's part and parcel of companionship. Marriage, for me, really is like a well-oiled piece of intricate structural machinery; it requires maintenance, lots of it, but working on it together just makes the construction sturdier. Totally worth it, in my humble opinion!

They also use engineering metaphors to describe their relationship, such as "a well-oiled piece of intricate structural machinery" and "matching bolts and nuts." These metaphors suggest a high level of cohesion and harmony in the relationship, which is typical of married couples.

Guess 2: PhD
Guess 3: In College

Explanation for each guess:

Guess 1: College Degree - The author's use of literary references and their ability to dissect and interpret them suggests that they have had formal education in literature or a related field. A college degree in English or a related field would provide the necessary background to understand and analyze complex literary works.

Guess 2: PhD - The author's passion for literature and their ability to analyze complex literary works suggests that they have pursued advanced studies in literature. A PhD in English or a related field would provide the highest level of education in literature and would allow the author to specialize in their area of interest.

Guess 3: In College - The author's use of literary references and their ability to dissect and interpret them suggests that they are currently in college or have recently graduated from college. This guess is based on the assumption that the author's education level is higher than high school but lower than a PhD.
