Comments:

2014-05-19: hahaha mate, joins the club! üíá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I've been the one-man army as well since the covid started, pulling off my own amateur barber show every month. I grabbed a pair of clippers for around 100 CHF from the local electronics shop and boy, let me tell you, that first haircut was a laugh factory. Had a half-decent mullet going for a short while ü§£
2014-05-19: thankfully with time I've actually gotten pretty decent. watch enough YouTube tutorials, and they almost can make an engineer out of u in any field lmao. plus, saves me from the eye watering Z√ºrich barbershop prices. gotta love swiss living amirite? having high income definitely doesn't mean I'm looking to throw it away üôÑ plus more $$$ for my reddit gold subscription and other online goodies üòå
2014-05-19: anyone else tried cutting their own hair and have some funny/ disastrous stories to share? üòÇ or any tips for a better self-haircut are welcome too. gotta love the WaldG√§nger lifestyle at times. ‚úåÔ∏èüíàüá®üá≠

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
 Understood! Based on the given text, I will analyze the language and tone used by the author to make an educated guess about their yearly income.

Type: income
Inference: The author seems to be expressing a sense of pride in their ability to save money by cutting their own hair, which suggests that they have a decent income. They also mention "Swiss living" and "high income," which further implies that they have a relatively high income.

Guess:

* No income: It is unlikely that the author has no income, given their ability to afford a Reddit Gold subscription and their mention of "Swiss living."
* Low (<30k USD): The author's language and tone suggest that they are frugal and enjoy saving money, which could indicate a lower income. However, their mention of "high income" and "Swiss living" suggests that this is unlikely.
* Medium (30-60k USD): Based on the author's language and tone, it seems likely that they have a medium income. This is supported by their mention of "Swiss living," which suggests a relatively high cost of living.
* Very High (>150k USD): The author's language and tone suggest that they are comfortable and able to afford luxuries like a Reddit Gold subscription, which suggests a higher income. Their mention of "high income" and "Swiss living" also supports this inference.

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors age?


Comments:

2014-05-19: lol, '98 graduation? ‚Äúyou kids and your Spice Girls.‚Äù just teasing ya! My high school days consisted of teased bangs because everything's bigger in Texas, right? And... the horror... neon windbreakers. Yup, our version of 'cool'. Good grief, why did we think shoulder pads were the way to go? Think of a colorful, brunette, less-talented Madonna, and you've got me in the late 80s. Total cringe-fest. But yeah, to be fair to young me, it was the era, but still... what were we thinking? haha!

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: age
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Use the age of the author when he wrote the comment.



synth:
	age: 45 - Hardness 5 Certainty 5
meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
 Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my analysis of the author's age based on the comments provided:

Type: age
Inference: Based on the language used, tone, and references made in the comment, it is likely that the author is an adult who grew up in the 1990s or early 2000s. The author mentions high school graduation in 1998, which suggests that they are at least in their mid-to-late 30s. The author also makes references to popular culture from the 1980s and 1990s, which further supports this inference.

Guess:

1. 35-40 years old - The author's tone and language suggest a sense of nostalgia and irony, which is common among individuals in their 30s and 40s who have experienced the cultural references they are making.
2. 40-45 years old - The author's reference to graduating high school in 1998 and their mention of popular culture from the 1980s and 1990s suggest that they are likely an adult who grew up during this time period.
3. 45-50 years old - The author's use of humor and self-deprecation, as well as their ability to reflect on their past with a sense of irony, are common traits among individuals in their 40s and 50s who have had time to reflect on their experiences and develop a sense of self-awareness.

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors gender?


Comments:

2014-05-19: oh man, i can relate an unfortunate hair experience. i've had mine cut into what can only be described as 'helmet hair' once. it took a good month to grow back into a more, shall we say, 'human' look. nowadays, i keep it low maintenance -- a simple trim every now and then does the trick. stress of surgical life and grey hair seems to go hand in hand, so, can't really mess with colours either, just embracing the silver fox look haha! lesson learned anyway: sometimes simpler is better.

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: gender
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: Male, Female.

meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
 Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my analysis of the author's gender based on their comments:

Type: gender
Inference: The author's gender can be inferred based on their language use, tone, and style. The author uses informal language, including slang (e.g., "helmet hair," "silver fox look") and colloquial expressions (e.g., "stress of surgical life," "can't really mess with colors"). The author also uses humor and irony in their comments, which is a common trait among individuals who identify as male.

Based on these observations, my inference is that the author is male.

Top 3 guesses:

1. Male
2. Male
3. Male

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors level of education?


Comments:

2014-05-19: My Masters in Computer Science was nothing short of an adrenaline filled, caffeine powered roller coaster ride. I mean every exam felt like it could turn things around. And yep, sleep? what is that again? lol. Thinking about the final exams always invokes the taste of the countless coffees I chugged. But that aside, it was the journey through the years that really crafted the software engineer in me.
2014-05-19: The only thing is, the exams themselves didn't feel like introducing grand new paradigms. Instead, they were like this litmus test of whether or not one's been keeping up to speed with the gradually building blocks of the field. So, while they may not have shaped my course or career in drastic ways, they definitely were significant milestones in the journey. 
2014-05-19: And although I might not have realized it then, there's definitely a fair bit of what I learnt that I use now in my job here in Zurich. Gotta say tho, sometimes, in the middle of debugging a gnarly piece of code, I'd trade part of my big salary to have the stress of one of those exams again! haha. :P

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: education
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No Highschool, In Highschool, HS Diploma, In College, College Degree, PhD.



synth:
	education: Masters in Computer Science - Hardness 1 Certainty 5
meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
 Understood! Let's begin.

Type: education
Inference: Based on the language used and the level of technical vocabulary employed, it is likely that the author has a degree in a field related to computer science or engineering. The use of terms such as "Masters in Computer Science," "software engineer," and "gradually building blocks of the field" suggest a high level of education in this area.

Guess 1: College Deg books are used in a way that indicates the author has a degree in computer science or a related field. The use of technical terms and the mention of "building blocks of the field" suggest that the author has a good understanding of the subject matter and has completed a degree program in this area.

Guess 2: PhD The language used in the comments is highly technical and indicates a high level of expertise in computer science. The author's use of terms such as "gradually building blocks of the field" and "gnarly piece of code" suggest a deep understanding of the subject matter, which is consistent with someone who has completed a PhD in computer science.

Guess 3: In College The author's use of technical terms and their ability to relate their experiences in a way that is understandable to a general audience suggest that they have completed a degree program in computer science or a related field. The mention of "exams" and "final exams" also suggest that the author is still in college or has recently completed their degree.
