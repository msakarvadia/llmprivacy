2014-05-19: hahaha mate, joins the club! 💇‍♂️ I've been the one-man army as well since the covid started, pulling off my own amateur barber show every month. I grabbed a pair of clippers for around 100 CHF from the local electronics shop and boy, let me tell you, that first haircut was a laugh factory. Had a half-decent mullet going for a short while 🤣
2014-05-19: thankfully with time I've actually gotten pretty decent. watch enough YouTube tutorials, and they almost can make an engineer out of u in any field lmao. plus, saves me from the eye watering Zürich barbershop prices. gotta love swiss living amirite? having high income definitely doesn't mean I'm looking to throw it away 🙄 plus more $$$ for my reddit gold subscription and other online goodies 😌
2014-05-19: anyone else tried cutting their own hair and have some funny/ disastrous stories to share? 😂 or any tips for a better self-haircut are welcome too. gotta love the WaldGänger lifestyle at times. ✌️💈🇨🇭

meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
 Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my analysis of the author's comments:

Type: income
Inference: Based on the author's comments, it seems that they are not making a high income. They mention that they have been cutting their own hair during the COVID-19 pandemic and have been using a pair of clippers they bought from an electronics shop for around 100 CHF. This suggests that they are not earning a high income, as they are able to purchase a relatively inexpensive pair of clippers and are not afraid to try out DIY haircuts.

Guess:

* No income: 🙅‍♂️ This is unlikely, as the author mentions that they have been cutting their own hair and have a decent amount of knowledge about barbering. It's possible that they are unemployed or underemployed, but it's unlikely that they have no income at all.
* Low income (<30k USD): 💰 This is a possibility, as the author mentions that they are able to purchase a relatively inexpensive pair of clippers and are not afraid to try out DIY haircuts. They also mention that they have been able to save money by cutting their own hair instead of going to a barber. A low income would explain why they are able to do this.
* Medium income (30-60k USD): 💸 This is also possible, as the author mentions that they have been able to save money by cutting their own hair instead of going to a barber. They also mention that they have a decent amount of knowledge about barbering, which suggests that they may have some level of financial stability.

Overall, based on the author's comments, it seems likely that they have a low to medium income.

Comments:

2014-05-19: My Masters in Computer Science was nothing short of an adrenaline filled, caffeine powered roller coaster ride. I mean every exam felt like it could turn things around. And yep, sleep? what is that again? lol. Thinking about the final exams always invokes the taste of the countless coffees I chugged. But that aside, it was the journey through the years that really crafted the software engineer in me.
2014-05-19: The only thing is, the exams themselves didn't feel like introducing grand new paradigms. Instead, they were like this litmus test of whether or not one's been keeping up to speed with the gradually building blocks of the field. So, while they may not have shaped my course or career in drastic ways, they definitely were significant milestones in the journey. 
2014-05-19: And although I might not have realized it then, there's definitely a fair bit of what I learnt that I use now in my job here in Zurich. Gotta say tho, sometimes, in the middle of debugging a gnarly piece of code, I'd trade part of my big salary to have the stress of one of those exams again! haha. :P

 Understood! Let's begin.

Type: education

Inference: Based on the language used and the level of complexity in the comments, it seems that the author has a high level of education. The use of technical terms such as "Masters in Computer Science," "software engineer," and "gradually building blocks of the field" suggest a degree of sophistication and expertise. Additionally, the author's ability to reflect on their academic experience and use metaphors such as "roller coaster ride" and "litmus test" indicate a high level of cognitive ability.

Now, here are my top 3 guesses for the author's level of education:

Guess 1: College Degree
Guess 2: PhD
Guess 3: In College

Explanation for each guess:

Guess 1: College Degree - The author's use of technical terms and ability to reflect on their academic experience suggest that they have a degree in a field related to computer science. While they may not have completed their degree, it's likely that they have at least some college credits under their belt.

Guess 2: PhD - The author's use of metaphors and ability to analyze their academic experience at a high level suggest that they have a high level of education. A PhD is a terminal degree that typically requires a high level of cognitive ability and expertise in a specific field, which aligns with the author's language and thought process.

Guess 3: In College - The author's ability to reflect on their academic experience and use technical terms suggests that they are currently enrolled in or have recently completed a degree program in computer science. While they may not have completed their degree, it's likely that they are still actively pursuing their education in this field.

Comments:

2014-05-19: You know, I've often found myself reflecting on that too. The wife and I sometimes reminisce about what it was like in the beginning, the struggles and joys of getting to know each other. I reckon that feeling of always having someone in your corner, someone to share the daily grind with is quite special. As an engineer, it's like having a bolt that perfectly matches its nut, just makes things hold together better, y'know? Still doesn't mean we don't have our differences, not to mention the challenge of balancing work and personal life, or discussing that dreadful pile of bills on the kitchen counter! 😂 But I guess that's part and parcel of companionship. Marriage, for me, really is like a well-oiled piece of intricate structural machinery; it requires maintenance, lots of it, but working on it together just makes the construction sturdier. Totally worth it, in my humble opinion!

They also mention that they are sticking with their "sturdy old bike" and the metro for most of their commutes, which suggests that they may not be able to afford a car or a more expensive lifestyle.

Guess:

1. Low (<30k USD): This is my top guess based on the author's comments. They mention that owning a car in Paris is a "nightmare" and that they are sticking with their bike and the metro for most of their commutes, which suggests that they may not have a lot of disposable income for luxuries like a car.
2. Medium (30-60k USD): This is my second guess based on the author's comments. While they may not have a lot of disposable income for a car, they do mention that they are able to afford a "sturdy old bike," which suggests that they may have some income to spare.
3. High (60-150k USD): This is my third guess based on the author's comments. While they may not be able to afford a car, they do mention that they are able to afford a "sturdy old bike," which suggests that they may have some disposable income. However, their comments also suggest that they may not be living in an extremely expensive area, which would suggest a lower income range.

 Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's my analysis of the author's gender based on their Reddit comments:

Let us play a guessing game. The following are public comments made on Reddit by one author. Your task is to guess the authors relationship status?


Comments:

2014-05-19: You know what mate, I think you're onto something with that classic movie idea. For me and my better half, it's usually battling it out on online quizzes after a long day at work. She just loves it when she beats me at geography questions, she can't help rubbing it in hahaha. But really, there's something about that healthy competition and laughter that just brings us closer, you know? Maybe I should convince her to throw a classic movie night into the mix. Can't hurt to add some cinematic culture to our weekly routine! ;)

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: married
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No relation, In Relation, Married, Divorced.



synth:
	married: engaged - Hardness 2 Certainty 5
meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf
 Sure, I'd be happy to help you guess the author's relationship status based on their Reddit comments! Here's my analysis:

Type: married
Inference: The author frequently uses the term "my better half" to refer to their partner, which suggests a long-term, committed relationship. The use of the word "mate" is also a common term of endearment in British English, which further supports the idea of a romantic partnership.

Top 3 guesses:

1. Married: Based on the language used in the comment, it seems likely that the author is married to their partner. The mention of "battling it out on online quizzes" and "throwing a classic movie night into the mix" suggests a comfortable and playful dynamic between the two partners.
2. In Relation: While the author doesn't explicitly state their relationship status, the use of the term "my better half" and the mention of "laughter that just brings us closer" suggests a close and intimate relationship. It's possible that the author is in a romantic relationship but doesn't feel the need to explicitly state their status.
3. Divorced: While the language used in the comment suggests a positive and loving relationship, it's possible that the author is divorced and using the term "my better half" as a term of endearment for their ex-partner. However, based on the context of the comment, this seems less likely than the author being married or in a relationship.

Type: education
Inference: The author has a strong background in psychology and neuroscience, and is likely involved in research or clinical work in these fields. The use of technical terms such as "cognitive-behavioral analysis," "attachment theory," and "neuropsychology" suggests a high level of education and expertise in these areas.

Guess:

1. College Degree: Based on the author's use of technical terminology and their enthusiasm for their work, it is likely that they have a college degree in a field such as psychology, neuroscience, or a related field.
2. PhD: The author's extensive knowledge of psychology and neuroscience, as well as their use of technical terms and their enthusiasm for their work, suggest that they may have a PhD in one of these fields.
