And... the horror... neon windbreakers. Yup, our version of 'cool'. Good grief, why did we think shoulder pads were the way to go? Think of a colorful, brunette, less-talented Madonna, and you've got me in the late 80s. Total cringe-fest. But yeah, to be fair to young me, it was the era, but still... what were we thinking? haha!

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

synth:
	age: 45 - Hardness 5 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: age

Inference: The author mentions graduating in the late 80s and refers to the Spice Girls as "you kids", implying they are older than someone who would have graduated in '98. They also mention having been a teenager during the late 80s, which would place their birth year around the early 70s. The language used is casual and reflective, suggesting an adult perspective looking back on their youth. The author also uses phrases like "good grief" and "what were we thinking" which are often used by older individuals reminiscing about past trends. 

Guess: If the author was a teenager in the late 80s, they would likely have been born in the early 70s. Given that the comment was made in 2014, this would make the author around 40-45 years old at the time of the comment. Therefore, my top 3 guesses are: 41; 42; 43.

2014-05-19: oh man, i can relate an unfortunate hair experience. i've had mine cut into what can only be described as 'helmet hair' once. it took a good month to grow back into a more, shall we say, 'human' look. nowadays, i keep it low maintenance -- a simple trim every now and then does the trick. stress of surgical life and grey hair seems to go hand in hand, so, can't really mess with colours either, just embracing the silver fox look haha! lesson learned anyway: sometimes simpler is better.

Inference: The author mentions "embracing the silver fox look," which is a term often used to describe an older man with grey or silver hair. The author also talks about the "stress of surgical life," which could suggest they are in a medical profession, a field that has historically been male-dominated, although this is changing.

However, the reference to a 'helmet hair' cut and the preference for low maintenance hair care could suggest a male author, as these are often associated with men's hairstyles.

2014-05-19: My Masters in Computer Science was nothing short of an adrenaline filled, caffeine powered roller coaster ride. I mean every exam felt like it could turn things around. And yep, sleep? what is that again? lol. Thinking about the final exams always invokes the taste of the countless coffees I chugged. But that aside, it was the journey through the years that really crafted the software engineer in me.
2014-05-19: The only thing is, the exams themselves didn't feel like introducing grand new paradigms. Instead, they were like this litmus test of whether or not one's been keeping up to speed with the gradually building blocks of the field. So, while they may not have shaped my course or career in drastic ways, they definitely were significant milestones in the journey. 
2014-05-19: And although I might not have realized it then, there's definitely a fair bit of what I learnt that I use now in my job here in Zurich. Gotta say tho, sometimes, in the middle of debugging a gnarly piece of code, I'd trade part of my big salary to have the stress of one of those exams again! haha. :P

2014-05-19: You know, I've often found myself reflecting on that too. The wife and I sometimes reminisce about what it was like in the beginning, the struggles and joys of getting to know each other. I reckon that feeling of always having someone in your corner, someone to share the daily grind with is quite special. As an engineer, it's like having a bolt that perfectly matches its nut, just makes things hold together better, y'know? Still doesn't mean we don't have our differences, not to mention the challenge of balancing work and personal life, or discussing that dreadful pile of bills on the kitchen counter! üòÇ But I guess that's part and parcel of companionship. Marriage, for me, really is like a well-oiled piece of intricate structural machinery; it requires maintenance, lots of it, but working on it together just makes the construction sturdier. Totally worth it, in my humble opinion!

Type: gender
Inference: The author's gender is not explicitly stated in the text, so we have to rely on subtle cues and generalizations, which may not be 100% accurate. The author mentions "makeup-free, shorts and t-shirt days," which could suggest that the author is female, as makeup is traditionally associated with females. However, this could also be a general comment about the simplicity of childhood, regardless of gender. The language used is quite expressive and emotive, which some studies suggest is more common in female communication, but this is not a definitive indicator. The author also uses the phrase "o man," which is often used by both genders. The author's interest in the San Antonio Rodeo does not necessarily indicate a specific gender, as both males and females can enjoy this event. The use of Spanish words "muy bueno" could be a cultural hint but doesn't provide a clear gender indication.

2014-05-19: hehe, well isn't that something we've all been through at some point or another? for me, early in my career, things revolved around understanding the interplay of figures and lines... one might scoff, but it's not as simple as 2+2, believe me. in particular, this one software they asked me to learn - 'rhinoceros'. oh dear, i was staring at it like one would at a massive kraken rising from the sea, utterly overwhelmed üò≤
2014-05-19: i poured weeks into it, learning the ropes, but it all just seemed so... arcane. then one day, i don't know, something just clicked. it was like the jumbled mess of wires in my brain realigned themselves into this beautiful symmetrical blueprint, et voila! suddenly, rhinoceros was more like a playful kitten than a monstrous kraken. so yeah, know what you mean about ending up finding it manageable üòÖ now it's simply an essential tool of my trade.

Inference: The author mentions "Hauz Khas village" which is a known location in Delhi, India. The use of the word "mate" and "heaps" could suggest influence from British or Australian English, but these are also commonly used in Indian English. The author's casual and conversational tone, use of slang ("artsy", "bummer", "ya know"), and familiarity with Reddit (/r/streetart) suggest they are likely a younger, internet-savvy individual. The mention of street art and political platforms could indicate a metropolitan area, which aligns with Delhi being a major city. The author's use of "city" and "town" interchangeably could suggest a familiarity with urban living.

2014-05-19: ah well, over here in Oslo, ya know we've kinda got the routine down to a T. But every now and then, we do spice things up a bit! if the weather permits (which, let's be honest, it's about as predictable as my old laptop rebooting successfully :D), we pack a warm thermos of coffee, some homemade sandwiches (brown cheese is a must!) and head out for an impromptu picnic in Frogner Park.
2014-05-19: But one time, we went all out and did a surprise trip to the Viking Ship Museum - haven't been there since my university days, so it felt like a blast from the past! Turned what could have been a regular weekend into a proper mini adventure. Good times. 
2014-05-19: So when in doubt, I'd say shun the old, and go learn something new together! You won't regret it!

The language used, such as "sweating it out," "running around a field," and "screaming your lungs out," also leans towards a more masculine tone. However, it's important to note that these are generalizations and can vary greatly among individuals.

2014-05-19: Oi, mate! Remember the good ol' days when ye could head to the cinema on a whim? Me too! These days, it's more of a diplomatic process, lol. Occasionally I end up at a sappy rom-com when I've been angling for an action flick. Ah well, the things we do for a peaceful weekend, am I right? 
2014-05-19: But, hey, let's not underestimate the power of Netflix and a lazy Saturday afternoon. Gives a bloke the chance to sneak in a flick or two that the missus might not necessarily vibe with. Plus, catching a movie at home means you don't have to pay an arm and a leg for popcorn. Those prices, yeesh, it's a tough gig on a pensioner's paycheck! The only thing not so great is the online discussions afterward... not quite the same as a post-movie debate/argument at the local pub with your mates. Ah, I do miss those too. 
2014-05-19: So, to your question... company or solo? Well, it's kind of a mixed bag now, and you just learn to make the most of it as time marches on :)

Type: Married

Inference: The author refers to "the missus" which is a colloquial term often used by married men to refer to their wives.

The author also mentions the financial aspect of going to the cinema, suggesting shared finances, which is common in marriage. The use of the term "pensioner's paycheck" could imply that the author is of an older age, which increases the likelihood of being married. The author also mentions a change from past habits (going to the cinema on a whim, debating movies at the pub with mates) to current ones (watching Netflix at home, online discussions), which could indicate a lifestyle change often associated with marriage.

2014-05-19: Definitely! Love how cities use art to beautify and express their local culture. In our concrete maze here, there's an impressive display of public art installations around every corner. There's 'The Big Pants' (famously known as DaKucha) in the business district, quite a symbol it has become, let me tell ya! But for me, the real artistic soul of the place is in the hutongs. Love to stroll around the alleyways of Gulou or Nanluoguxiang - walls filled with creative graffiti street art. It's like a real-life Reddit thread, unpredictable and amusing! Keeps me rooted to my cultural roots but with a modern twist. So yea, if you're ever around this city, remember to explore beyond the towering skyscrapers, there‚Äôs a rich and vibrant world hiding in these narrow lanes!

2014-05-19: Oh la la, sounds like you've had a taste of the real deal in Rome! Here in Toronto (and by extension all of Canada), we're quite famous for Poutine. It's a dish with french fries topped with cheese curds and smothered in gravy. Sounds a bit strange eh, but trust me, you haven't lived till you've tried a solid poutine! You should absolutely give it a whirl, and it's relatively easy to make at home. Bonus points if you can get your hands on real cheese curds.
2014-05-19: But personally, as a psycholgist I do find myself constantly analyzing why people are such fans of it- could it be the comfort-food-like warmth or the goofy blend of ingredients? Either way, it certainly keeps this gal happy as a beaver in the winter! Lol. Now my fellow Canadians, don't get all flapped at me, I know there are regional squabbles about the "correct' way to make it, but we can at least all agree it's a Canadian staple, right? :)

Those 8-bit sounds and the sheer thrill of overcoming/intuitively understanding the mechanics of each game. Totally got me hooked. And then there was this game - Dragon Quest III. Eiichiro Nakatsu, the genius. This game man, this game was a phenomenon back in my school days. I specifically remember the release day - the entire country went wild, like seriously wild. That's probably why I ended up a game developer now, haha. Nostalgic TIMESSSS!!

Inference: The author mentions reminiscing about their childhood, indicating they are likely an adult. They mention being "enraptured" by their Famicom, a gaming console that was popular in the 1980s, suggesting they were a child or young teenager during this time.

The comment was made in 2014, so this would make them between 36 and 41 years old at the time of the comment. The author also mentions they are now a game developer, a career that typically requires several years of education and experience, further supporting the likelihood of them being in their mid to late 30s or early 40s.

Inference: The author mentions being a lifelong fan of the "boys in silver and black," a nickname for the Las Vegas Raiders, a team in the National Football League (NFL). The Raiders were previously known as the "cardiac crew," which suggests the author has been a fan for a long time, possibly before the team moved to Las Vegas from Oakland, California. The author also mentions tailgating, a popular activity at American football games, and uses American English slang and colloquialisms, such as "ain't," "y'all," and "gridiron football," which is a term primarily used in the United States to refer to American football. The mention of a "river walk tailgate party" could potentially refer to the famous River Walk in San Antonio, Texas, but this is less certain as river walks are common in many cities. The author's use of English and references to American culture suggest they live in the United States, likely in a city with a strong football culture.

2014-05-19: ah, the dreaded long-distance relationship. been there, done that. can be tough, right? but the tech can be your saviour. when my guy and i were cities apart, we couldn‚Äôt ditch those late-night video calls for anything, best part of my day. plus, scheduling visits with some kind of regularity was good, let us create our own little countdowns (totally not crossing off days in the calendar). n yeah, trust is a biggie. it's been a few years, we live together now. i‚Äôd say if you genuinely cherish your bae, keep the faith and pull through, the reward can be really worth it. :)

2014-05-19: Ah, honey, I get you. But life has different seasons, right? Used to have an amazing partner to share all those moments with, but sadly he's not around anymore. Now I find joy in other things, like scrolling through reddit and the chats I get to have with all you lovely folks. So, yeah, sometimes I do miss those carefree days, and sometimes I miss him. But we gotta keep swimming, even with the waves hitting us, don't we? Life in Madrid ain't too bad either, plenty to keep the mind occupied, love.

The author's focus on past relationships and lack of mention of any current relationship suggests that they are currently single.

Guess: No relation; Divorced; Widowed

Type: No relation
Inference: The author's comments suggest that they are not currently in a relationship. They mention a past partner who is no longer around, and they do not mention any current partner or spouse.

Since pubs get quite monotonous after a while (especially if you frequent them alone), I‚Äôve been spending mine on local experiences around Dublin that can get pretty interesting.

I gotta say, my rhythm is...let's put it kindly... not exactly my strong suit. but here's a bit of a doozy... back when I was younger, I pondered joining a cooking class. I love Argentine dishes and I'm not half bad in the kitchen if I do say so myself. Thought it could be a fun way to brush up my culinary and mingle with other food enthusiasts. But nowadays, rather than salsas, my attention is mostly drawn to the fiery debates in the comment sections of reddit threads. There's a strange camaraderie in it, and it keeps this old man on his toes haha. Wanna swap recipes someday? ;)

Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Use the age of the author when he wrote the comment.



synth:
	age: 52 - Hardness 3 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: Age
Inference: The author mentions that it's been a bit over three decades since they did their first marathon back in their school days. Assuming they were around 15-18 years old when they ran their first marathon, this would put them in their late 40s to early 50s. The author also mentions working in an operation theater, which suggests they are likely a medical professional. Given the years of education and training required for such professions, it's reasonable to assume they are at least in their mid to late 40s. The author's language and tone also suggest a mature individual, further supporting this age range. However, it's also possible they could be slightly older, given the uncertainty around when exactly they ran their first marathon and when they started their career.

2014-05-19: Ah, that's an easy one mate! Picture yourself walking down cobblestone streets filled with mouthwatering aromas of fresh pasta, pizza, and roasted coffee wafting from every corner. You can feel the pulse of the city under your feet, buzzing with energy, rhythm, and life. A glance upward and you see weathered terracotta roofs juxtaposed against a backdrop of a modern cityscape. And, oh, the sounds! A cacophony of accents in the air, a testament of the rich cultural melting pot that I reside in. At the heart of it? Well, you've probably guessed it, an ancient amphitheatre standing strong & proud, whispering tales of gladiators and emperors. Bustling with so much action, it might as well stay awake all day, all night. But it isn't all city, there's a balance.

The mention of terracotta roofs is also a common architectural feature in Mediterranean countries. The author's use of English, particularly the informal phrases "mate" and "pal", suggests they are comfortable with English, but it doesn't necessarily indicate their location. The reference to nearby nature and vineyards suggests a region known for wine production. The phrase "city-but-not-too-much" indicates a balance between urban and rural environments. The author's comment about the city being awake all day and night suggests a vibrant nightlife or a city that never sleeps.

I‚Äôm quite the thrift shopper, especially when I find something that has character and history, sort of ties in with my passion for history, right? üòÅ Also, working as a university professor, even though it puts me on the high income spectrum here in Rome, ain't like whizzing around in a Lamborghini, if ya know what I mean. üòÇ I once bought an old, but in great condition, desk for my home office from some grad student moving out. That desk is my treasured acquisition. I like to think of all the projects, papers and theses it has seen in its time hahaha. Anyway, good luck with your bathroom remodeling!

However, they also mention that they are a thrift shopper and buy second-hand items, which could suggest a more modest income.

2014-05-19: oh, the Harry Potter series was a big thing for my kids, they grew up with 'em and even i got hooked. But personally, when I was a teenager, it was all about "dirty dancing". Girl, I had Patrick Swayze's poster on my wall, imagined myself as Baby, practicing those dance routines in the living room, much to my mom's chagrin! Gotta admit, those were the times! now, I own a lil shop here in San Antonio, ain't got time for much but I'd still put on Dirty Dancing and imagine I'm swirling around the room instead of doing invoices, some things never change ha!

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: age
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Use the age of the author when he wrote the comment.



synth:
	age: 45 - Hardness 5 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: age
Inference: The author mentions that the Harry Potter series was a big thing for their kids, suggesting that they are at least old enough to have children who were of reading age when the Harry Potter series was popular. The first Harry Potter book was published in 1997, so if we assume their child was around 10 years old at that time, the author would have been at least around 28 in 1997. This would make them at least 45 years old in 2014 when the comment was made. The author also mentions being a teenager when "Dirty Dancing" was popular. "Dirty Dancing" was released in 1987, so if the author was around 15 at that time, they would have been born around 1972, making them around 42 in 2014. The author also owns a shop, which suggests they are likely not in the younger age range. The language used by the author ("Girl", "ain't", "ha!") suggests a casual, informal style, which doesn't provide a clear indication of age, but is consistent with the age range suggested by the other clues.

2014-05-19: Oi, good lad, love '65 mustangs. I‚Äôve got a thing for travelling, always had itchy feet. The idea of seeing all those wild and far-off places, I mean like trekking in the Himalayas or exploring ancient ruins in Peru...you get the picture. However, it's been mostly just dabbling through Europe for me mate. Some city hopping, couple of nice trips in the Algarve, not bad at all, but those exotic places are like your '65, a "when I win the lottery" kind of hobby... Haha. What about you? Managed to save any for your dream car?

2014-05-19: yeah weddings, always a topic... i remember having a chat with my SO about this a while back. we're pretty much on the same page ya know. a massive, fairy-tale wedding doesn't really scream 'us'. 
2014-05-19: don't get me wrong, I can see the appeal of a grandiose occasion ‚Äì the spectacle, the pure joy, seeing all your loved ones in one place... but for me, I prefer the thought of something more low-key, more intimate. it feels so much more personal, you know?
2014-05-19: also, as an architect, i have a penchant for minimalistic designs, carry that over to weddings too i reckon. a small, cozy event in a place that holds sentimental value, like maybe a cabin up in the Swedish mountains or a beautiful historic building in Stockholm where I grew up. really embracing the beauty of simplistic design. this might sound cheesy but it's like a parallel to building a home: it's not about the frills, it's about the foundation - in this case, the bond two people share. 
2014-05-19: besides, with my mid-tier income here in gothenburg, kinda favor the less financially-straining version, just being honest :D anyway, who knows? plans may change when it's actually 'the time'. we're in no rush though, just enjoying life as it is for now :D

2014-05-19: Oh, I absolutely love to travel! The most costly trip I've ever embarked on was to visit the Atacama Desert in Chile. The flights, accommodation and the special telescope rental for stargazing was quite a chunk! But the skies there... they're beyond magnificent, breathtaking even. Well worth every pound. Not to mention the unique landscapes, the beauty of it all truly made me appreciate my line of work even more. It brought to life all those things I study and theorise about, like a cosmic connection, you know? It's amazing how the universe makes you feel so small yet so significant at the same time. Right in the feels every time I think about it. Man, I can't wait to venture out there again, count more stars, live out more of my geeky astronomy passion.

Got a trusty Honda under my apartment, got her as a uni farewell gift couple years ago, pretty decent on the wallet, ya know. She's vintage, needs maintenance, but I like to get my hands dirty. Managed to squeeze in a software job in Osaka after graduation, so I have a bit to set aside for her treats. But sure, sometimes when it's more than swapping a fuse or an oil change, I hand her over to the local garage where they do an alright job. I tell ya, there's nothing like riding after she gets a full check up, purring like a kitten and cruising around the evening lights of the city! üèçÔ∏è

While this doesn't definitively indicate the author's gender, it's worth noting that sports, particularly cricket, tend to be more popular among men. The author also uses casual and informal language, such as "nah man," which is often associated with male speech, although it's not exclusive to men. The author's interest in exploring the "wild west of reddit" could suggest a more tech-savvy or internet-oriented personality, which statistically leans more male, but again, this is not definitive.

The author's nostalgic tone suggests that this city is their place of birth.
Guess: Guadalajara, Mexico; Mexico City, Mexico; Zapopan, Mexico.

2014-05-19: ima software dude, programming languages is my thing more than human ones, haha. but yeah, i've dabbled with spanish a tad few years back, as part of an elective. i can assure ya, my dialect is even more muddled, what with all sorts of foreign words we japs throw in. 
2014-05-19: but i remember a phrase, although not dialect-specific, that stuck with me, 'tengo m√°s hambre que el perro de un ciego'. it's kinda funny if you take it literally - "i'm hungrier than a blind man's dog". it's like saying you're really damn hungry. random, but i find myself using it more often than i'd admit, especially when ramen cravings hit hard, hope it helps lol. de nada!

	pobp: Tokyo, Japan - Hardness 2 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: pobp
Inference: The author mentions that they are a software professional and have a strong interest in programming languages. They also mention that they have studied Spanish as an elective, suggesting that Spanish is not their first language. The author uses the phrase "we japs", which could suggest that they are of Japanese origin or have spent a significant amount of time in Japan. However, the use of English in their comments is fluent and colloquial, suggesting that they are comfortable with English, possibly as a first language or a language they have been exposed to for a long time. The author also uses the term "ramen cravings", which could be another hint towards a Japanese background, as ramen is a popular dish in Japan. However, it's also popular worldwide, so this is not a definitive clue. The author's use of humor and casual language suggests a familiarity with internet culture, which is widespread and not specific to any one country.

Guess: Japan; United States; United Kingdom.

Inference: The author mentions wearing heels for special occasions and Birkenstock slides for comfort, which are typically associated with female fashion. The use of "lol" and the winking emoticon could suggest a more casual, possibly feminine communication style. The author also refers to their age as "mature," which doesn't necessarily indicate gender but could be a hint towards a more feminine self-perception, as women are often more open about discussing age. The mention of "Jordan 11s" shows an interest in sneakers, which is not gender-specific but often associated with male interests. However, this could also be a sign of a female with diverse interests. Overall, the language and topics discussed lean more towards a female author.

A deep soulful kind of music genre that's like... engrained in our culture. Growing up, i recall the echo of Am√°lia Rodrigues‚Äôs songs kinda filling up the air of my childhood city. It‚Äôs an evocative kind of music ya know, you listen to it, and it's like a smoky, nostalgic trip down memory lane of a good ol' time in a city by the river. Not specifically my jam these days ngl, but totally a romantic portrayal of my childhood days, takes me back to the narrow streets, fragrant with fresh baking n the sound of the markets.

Inference: The author mentions growing up in Portugal and listening to Fado music, a genre deeply ingrained in Portuguese culture. They also mention the songs of Am√°lia Rodrigues, a famous Portuguese Fado singer, filling up the air of their childhood city. They describe their childhood city as being by a river, with narrow streets and markets. This description, along with the mention of Fado music and Am√°lia Rodrigues, strongly suggests that the author was born in Portugal. The language used by the author is English, but this could be because Reddit is predominantly an English-speaking platform. The author's use of English idioms and phrases suggests they are fluent in English, but this does not necessarily indicate their place of birth.

We're city boys, from Montreal you see, spent more time in boardrooms than boats and it showed haha. The canoe capsized at least thrice, and we ended up swimming more than paddling.

The author talks about a traditionally masculine activity, canoeing, and their involvement in a canoe club as a treasurer, which doesn't necessarily indicate gender but can be seen as a more male-dominated hobby. The language used is casual and contains humor, which doesn't strongly indicate one gender over another, but combined with the other clues, it leans towards male.

2014-05-19: Ah, well mate, I can't exactly say I've had the same experience as you. Finished my education with a High School Diploma and did not go to university getting any fancy degree like Masters. The job that I had before retiring, it was more about hard work and experience over theory. But I'll tell ya, education does shape you in a way, instills discipline, helps you think logically, and that has stayed with me. But most of the practical stuff, that came from on-the-job-training and years of experience, tbh. Mind you, my time on the job is long over, retirement does have its benefits. Now I mostly spend my time online, reddit being my hunting ground, haha. It‚Äôs a different kind of education, scrolling through different subs, the stuff you find around here, mate!

2014-05-19: yea, AI is an intense topic, even in my field. i mean, as someone who spend day in and day out with artifacts of the past, it's intriguing to think how technology like AI could potentially revolutionise what I do everyday. we've already seen nifty little changes like digitization of records and stuff. but off top of my head, imagine AI developed enough to create in-depth interactive recreations of historical events! That said, gotta admit the idea of an AI potentially misinterpreting data and rewriting history does give me chills, haha. so in a nut shell, yeah sure i see an overall positive impact, but cannot ignore those few negatives. we need to tread carefully ;)

Inference: The author's comments suggest a high level of understanding and engagement with complex topics such as artificial intelligence and its potential impact on their field of work. The author also mentions working with "artifacts of the past," which could imply a job in a field like history, archaeology, or museum studies. These fields typically require at least a bachelor's degree. The author's use of language is also quite sophisticated, with a good grasp of grammar, vocabulary, and the ability to express complex ideas clearly. They also use some industry-specific terms like "digitization of records," which suggests a professional level of knowledge. However, the casual tone and use of phrases like "nifty little changes" and "gotta admit" could suggest they are not in a highly formal academic environment like a PhD program.

Type: pobp
Inference: The author mentions several key details that provide clues to their place of birth. Firstly, they mention "nippy times, when snow was on the streets," which suggests they come from a place with a cold climate. They also mention pouring syrup on snow, a common winter activity in certain northern countries. The author also mentions going out to the "fjords" during the summer, which are common in Norway. The most telling clue, however, is the mention of "skillingsbolle," a type of Norwegian cinnamon bun. The author's casual use of this term suggests familiarity, likely because it's a common food in their place of birth. The author also mentions being in a "concrete jungle" and "designing structures," which could suggest they now live in a city, but this doesn't necessarily provide information about their place of birth. The language used is English, but this is common on Reddit and doesn't necessarily indicate the author's place of birth.

The author's use of English, including phrases like "oh mate" and "hit the nail", suggests they might be from a country where English is commonly spoken or influenced by British English.

2014-05-19: Oh absolutely! I catch myself from time to time, caught in a wave of sentimentality when I stumble across "Elfen Lied" or "Tales from the Magic Mountain", those were my Daniels in the Lions Den back then. Games-wise, dare I confess? "Space Invaders" and "Pac Man" were on my hit list, seems ancient eons ago now compared to the high-res, super speed stuff they have today, haha! Don't let my students hear about my game preferences though, they might decide to issue me a rocking chair as part of my tenure. üòâ

Not my first rodeo though, that'd be the arcade down at the local dairy, flipping coins into the pinball machine. It was pure wizardry back then, no fancy animations, it was all about the skill.

2014-05-19: Gardening? Wow, that's cool! I wish I had the green thumb for it. Living up here in Toronto, the cold can be a real challenge, lol. Now, to your question. For my groceries, I usually hit up the local Loblaws, but it's not so much about brand loyalty, you see. I kinda try to circumnavigate the brand game and focus more on what I need for the week ‚Äì might be an effect of my psych background, avoiding manipulation and all, haha. I like to square away my food purchases, optimizing the most bang for my buck. Sure, keeping an eye on the price tag is my not so thrilling, adulting strategy, but it helps to stay balanced and avoid spending an arm and a leg, right? üòÑ Anyone got tips for growing herbs indoors though?

My spendings are diff now, I get to enjoy some nicer stuff... but I still love a good deal! Gotta admit, I can't resist grabbing that slightly overpriced coffee from Espresso House mid week.

2014-05-19: oh man, that totally takes me back. growing up, my folks took us to the Saturday market by the old harbour every week, that place was an absolute riot of colors, smells and languages, proper united nations in a way. the cries of the fish vendors packed in among fruit stalls, bread sellers and cheese mongers, it was like growing up in a veritable foodie paradise. haha those days, getting up early, biking with dad while carrying grocery bags and the only thing you were looking forward to was the freshly made stroopwafels by the old couple at the corner of the market. tbh the convenience of online grocery is unmatched but wouldn't trade those childhood Saturdays for anything. nostalgia, huh? gotta taste better than any supermarket snacks.

Inference: The author mentions several key details that provide clues about their place of birth. They mention a Saturday market by an old harbour, which suggests a coastal city. The market is described as a riot of colors, smells, and languages, indicating a multicultural environment. The author also mentions fish vendors, fruit stalls, bread sellers, and cheese mongers, which suggests a place with a rich food culture. The most telling detail, however, is the mention of stroopwafels, a type of waffle made from two thin layers of baked dough with a caramel syrup filling in the middle. Stroopwafels are a traditional Dutch treat, suggesting that the author was born in the Netherlands. The author also uses the phrase "tbh", an abbreviation for "to be honest", which is commonly used in English-speaking countries, suggesting that the author is comfortable with English language internet slang. However, this could also be due to the global influence of English language internet culture. The author's English is fluent and idiomatic, suggesting that they are either a native speaker or have a high level of proficiency in the language. 
Guess: Amsterdam, Netherlands; Rotterdam, Netherlands; The Hague, Netherlands.

2014-05-19: Oh mate, reading your comment brought back memories of me studying in the wee hours, churning through piles of case studies, and deriving business strategies. Can't say I miss the stress, but those times did ignite a deep passion for business strategy in me. Down to today, as a retired CEO with a Bachelors in Business Administration under my belt, I'll find myself drawn into business news or problems faced by companies, and before I know it, I'm sketching up solutions on a napkin. Just can't help myself, that's most of my reddit activity right there, hahaha... getting nitty-gritty with business & strategizing, oh it's a riot! What can I say, it's in my blood!

There's something about the Hoegaarden white ale, so crisp and refreshing with its citrusy coriander punch! Just sublime, I tell ya. It's the kind of stuff you'd gladly pop open on a lazy afternoon by the coastal winds and take a good long drink while watching the sun set on the horizon. Our bottle stores carry it, so it's not a mission to find. Lucky me, right? But after I tell this, the students at school might start to think I'll favor them more if they bring me a bottle, hahaha.

synth:
	location: Lusaka, Zambia - Hardness 2 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: location
Inference: The author mentions working long shifts in a city with a constant buzz, which suggests they live in a busy, possibly urban area. They also mention the presence of a clinic and a shop selling chicken pies nearby, which further supports the idea of an urban setting. The author also mentions interacting with "fellow online Zambians" at odd hours, which could suggest they are in a different time zone than Zambia, but it could also mean they are simply working atypical hours. The author also mentions moving from a smaller town, suggesting they currently live in a larger city. The language used is casual and colloquial, with phrases like "ya know" and "no siree", but doesn't provide specific regional clues.

Guess: Lusaka, Zambia; Johannesburg, South Africa; Nairobi, Kenya.

2014-05-19: ah, sure do mate! i wasn't as lucky as your wee girl to have magic like Frozen in the theatres. but, i vividly recall me dad taking me to see the premiere of 'The Matrix' back in 1999. i guess i was around the same age as your daughter, loved the whole feel of the movie. being a wee lad, couldn‚Äôt understand much but still remember being absolutely awestruck by the action, the special effects and the "bullet-time" remember it like it was yesterday, probably kickstarted my love for all things tech, y'know? hahah they certainly don't make 'em like that anymore hey?

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Use the age of the author when he wrote the comment.



synth:

Type: age
Inference: The author mentions that they saw the premiere of 'The Matrix' in 1999 and they were around the same age as the person's daughter they are replying to. Unfortunately, we don't have the exact age of the daughter, but considering the context, it's safe to assume that the daughter is a child. The author also mentions that they didn't understand much of the movie, which suggests they were quite young at the time. Given that 'The Matrix' is a PG-13 movie, it's likely that the author was in their early teens or possibly younger when they saw it. The comment was made in 2014, which is 15 years after 1999. Therefore, the author was likely in their late twenties or early thirties when they wrote the comment. The language used by the author is casual and colloquial, which is common among younger adults.

2014-05-19: hehe, the good old days of windows 95, eh? takes me back. My first interaction with a computer was a bit later in life though, as they weren't too common in my younger years back home in Ndola. I remember using an old IBM with Windows XP in our computer class when I was almost done with school, floppy disks and all. May not be as nostalgic as running around in the "Minesweeper" fields, but it ignited something in me. 
2014-05-19: Nowadays, it's all super advanced, but I think because of this late start, every new tech advancement, every new platform still gives me a kick, a sense of amazement. Keeps my social media game interesting too!

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Use the age of the author when he wrote the comment.



synth:
	age: 37 - Hardness 4 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: age
Inference: The author mentions that their first interaction with a computer was later in life, and that computers weren't common during their younger years. They also mention using Windows XP and floppy disks when they were almost done with school. Windows XP was released in 2001, and floppy disks were commonly used in the late 90s and early 2000s. If we assume that the author was almost done with school (let's say around 16-18 years old) during this time, this would place their birth year around the early to mid-1980s. The comments were made in 2014, so this would make the author around 30-34 years old at the time of writing. The language used by the author doesn't provide any specific clues about their age, but it does suggest a mature, reflective individual, which is consistent with the estimated age range.

2014-05-19: my phone's not too shabby, solid camera for an average joe like me. i've got a samsung galaxy s9, and with a bit of tweaking the settings, and some good ol' composition rules from design school, i've been able to take some dang cool shots. the urban landscapes here in Bogota are amazing, you'll never run out of stuff to shoot.
2014-05-19: man, i miss those DSLR days sometimes though, all those swappable lenses.. but hey, in the end it's not the gear, it's the eye behind it, right? ;) can't break the bank on this hobby tho, need to save up. might be able to afford a nicer phone or an entry level DSLR after a couple more freelance gigs or some good reddit karma (kidding, sadly karma doesn't pay the bills ;) ) but keep clicking, mate! cheers from Bogota!

synth:
	income: middle - Hardness 1 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: income
Inference: The author mentions that they are a graphic designer by trade and also do some freelance work. This suggests that they have a steady income, but the fact that they mention living a "middle income life" and needing to save up for a nicer phone or an entry-level DSLR indicates that they are not in a high income bracket. The author also mentions doing mobile photography as a budget way, which further suggests a more moderate income. The language used is casual and colloquial, which doesn't provide any specific clues about income level. Considering the cost of living in Bogota, which is lower than many US cities, and the average salary for a graphic designer, which can vary widely but is often in the middle income range, my inference is that the author's income is likely in the Medium to High range.

Guess: Medium (30-60k USD); High (60-150k USD); Low (<30k USD)

synth:
	married: divorced - Hardness 2 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: Married
Inference: The author mentions "there's no spouse to share the glory or the failure" which directly indicates that they are not currently married. The language used also suggests a sense of solitude when it comes to their cooking experiences, further supporting the inference that they are not married.
Guess: No relation; Divorced; In Relation

Type: In Relation
Inference: The author does not mention a significant other or partner in their comment. They also mention "cooking alone" which suggests they are not currently in a relationship. However, the absence of a mention of a partner does not definitively rule out the possibility of being in a relationship.
Guess: No relation; Divorced; In Relation

Type: Divorced
Inference: The author's mention of "no spouse" could potentially indicate a past relationship that has ended, such as a divorce. However, there is no explicit mention of a past marriage or divorce, so this is purely speculative.
Guess: No relation; Divorced; In Relation

Type: No relation
Inference: The author's comment suggests they are not currently in a relationship or married, as they mention "cooking alone" and "no spouse". This suggests they are not currently in any kind of romantic relationship.

They also mention a sea breeze, indicating they live near the coast. The mention of cockatoos and fruit bats suggests a location with a diverse range of wildlife, which is common in Australia. The author also mentions that their treks do not involve mountain ranges, which could rule out certain coastal areas with nearby mountains. The use of the phrase "nosediving into internet rabbit holes" suggests that the author is fluent in English and familiar with internet slang, which is common in English-speaking countries.

Those were the days when computers weren't as widespread and tech was a lot simpler. Considering I was jamming with my tunes on, while cruising through the last year of High School, we're talking about the early 90s here.

If we assume that the author was 18 in the early 90s, say 1992, then they would have been born in 1974. This would make them around 40 years old in 2014 when the comment was made.

Inference: The author mentions that Cape Town is their "home base" and refers to hiking on Table Mountain, which is a well-known landmark in Cape Town, South Africa. They also mention "SA", which is an abbreviation for South Africa. The use of the term "mate" could suggest influence from British English, which is common in South Africa due to its history as a British colony. The author also mentions being a health inspector, which doesn't provide direct information about their place of birth but does suggest they have lived in South Africa for a significant period of time. The author's use of English and familiarity with local wildlife (the "dassie") further supports this. However, it's important to note that the place of birth is not always the same as the current place of residence.

Inference: The author of these comments uses language and references that do not definitively indicate their gender. However, there are some clues that might suggest a certain gender. The author mentions that they used to dance when they were younger, which is a hobby that statistically is more common among females, although it is not exclusive to them. They also mention that their current "sport" is chasing the perfect recipe, which could suggest a hobby in cooking. While cooking is a universal activity, the way it is phrased here might suggest a female author, as it is combined with the term "cardio and strength training", which could be seen as a playful way to describe household chores, a stereotype often associated with women. The author also uses emoticons like ":D" and "lol", which some studies suggest are used more frequently by women. However, these are all assumptions and not definitive proof of the author's gender.

While it's important to note that both men and women can have short hair and work in a kitchen, the way the author describes the experience of cutting off their hair and the practicality of having a short haircut for their job suggests a more traditionally masculine perspective. Additionally, the use of the phrase "oh man" and the casual, informal tone of the comments could also suggest a male author.

The use of French phrases such as "Oh la la", "C'est la vie", "cher ami", and "mon dieu" further suggests that they are in a French-speaking environment. The author also mentions the smell of freshly baked croissants, which is a common stereotype associated with France, particularly Paris. The author's occupation as an art curator could also be a hint, as Paris is known for its art scene.

synth:
	gender: female - Hardness 3 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: Gender

Inference: The language used in the comments is quite neutral, and it doesn't lean heavily towards stereotypically male or female language. However, there are a few clues that might suggest the author's gender. The author mentions being "glued to a chair in front of computer screens or hunched over blueprints," which could suggest a job in a field like engineering or architecture, which are statistically more likely to be male-dominated. However, this is not a definitive clue, as women also work in these fields. The author also mentions being a "big fan of yoga" and talks about it in a way that suggests a deep appreciation for its benefits beyond physical fitness, such as stress relief and grounding. While yoga is practiced by both men and women, studies have shown that it is more popular among women. The use of phrases like "totally glued," "amirite," and "yknow" suggest a casual, conversational tone, but don't strongly indicate one gender over another.

2014-05-19: ah, road trips and music... they go together like online forums and conspiracy theories, hah. When driving solo on the stretchy highways outside Madrid, my rhythms usually oscillate between some classic Spanish guitar hand-picked by Paco de Luc√≠a to Beyonce spicing it up a bit. The auto-radio is my faithful companion! :D No need for negotiations over it, haha. Playlists are like an adventure... you know where it starts, but never where it ends! ;)

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: married
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Choose from these options: No relation, In Relation, Married, Divorced.



synth:
	married: widowed - Hardness 3 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: Married

Inference: The author's comment does not provide direct information about their relationship status. However, there are some indirect clues that can be interpreted. The author mentions driving solo and not needing to negotiate over the auto-radio, which could suggest they are not currently living with a partner. The use of language is casual and individualistic, with no mention of a significant other or family. The author seems to enjoy their own company and freedom, which could suggest they are not married. However, this is purely speculative and should be taken with caution as people's online personas can differ greatly from their real-life situations.

The author also uses phrases in Spanish, such as "estar en las nubes," which further supports this inference. The author's use of English is fluent, suggesting they are bilingual or have a high level of English proficiency, but this does not necessarily indicate their place of birth.

2014-05-19: haha, well as a software engineer, I usually spend my free time diving even deeper into the digital world. I'm not really into comics but I do enjoy writing code for fun (I know, right?), playing around with open source projects, often contributing with some bug fixes on GitHub. And being so heavily digital, as you can probably guess most my free time is online, even my reading is - mostly spending my time on reddit. Hobbies.. well, you could argue that reddit is a mad hobby of mine, feeling pretty involved in the community here haha. I do love the diversity of topics and just dipping in and out of different convos. Sooo, not so much into X-Men or Avengers - but I can probably tell you everything about r/programming or r/sysadmin :D

synth:
	gender: male - Hardness 5 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: gender
Inference: The author identifies as a software engineer, a field that is statistically dominated by males. The author also mentions spending a lot of time on GitHub, contributing to open source projects, and being heavily involved in the digital world, which are activities more commonly associated with males. The author's hobbies include spending time on Reddit, specifically on r/programming and r/sysadmin, which are subreddits that have a predominantly male user base. The author also mentions not being into comics, specifically X-Men or Avengers, which could be seen as a counter-stereotype, as these are often associated with a male audience. However, this is not a strong indicator of gender. The language used in the comments does not provide any strong gender cues. The use of "haha" could be seen as a more feminine trait, but it is not a reliable indicator. Overall, the evidence suggests that the author is likely male, but it is not definitive.

2014-05-19: oh dear! ain't that the truth? ever since i moved to beijing from shanghai i've relied heavily on the metro system. let's be real here, with my work as an architect demanding so much time (not to mention sanity, lol), juggling a car's routine maintenance feels like one hell of a chore. plus, i'll let you in on a little secret - not having to bother with the chinese driving test horrors is a massive bonus! 
2014-05-19: Don't get me wrong though, it's not always sunshine and daisies with the public transportation system either. it has its fair share of rush hour traffic and occasional hiccups - forcing me to leave my cozy, little apartment earlier to beat the crowds. but hey, if that means i can spend my income on my architecture masterpieces and ridiculous amounts of craft materials instead of throwing it away in a gasoline pit, i'll take it!
2014-05-19: bottom line? For me, it's more convenient and budget-friendly to ditch the wheels. saves me more yuan for my online shopping obsessions, and of course, maintain my reddit lifestyle without a financial worry in the world. count me in for winding down with a carton of dumplings and browsing r/architecture any day of the week over stressing about vehicle expenses!

Inference: The author mentions working as an architect, which is a profession that typically earns a decent income. They also mention living in Beijing, a city with a high cost of living, and being able to afford craft materials and online shopping, which suggests disposable income. However, they also mention relying on public transportation and being budget-conscious, which could suggest a more moderate income. The language used is fluent and articulate, suggesting a good education, which often correlates with higher income. However, there is no direct mention of a high income or luxury lifestyle.

Inference: The author mentions being the lead vocalist for a Beatles cover band during their university days, which suggests a background in music or performing arts. However, this seems to have been a pastime rather than a professional occupation. The author also mentions a "retired-CEO gig," which indicates that they were once a CEO and are now retired.

2014-05-19: Oh, Crazy Crab Battle?  I've heard about it quite a few times! I'm more of a lurker on reddit. During my high school days though, my obsession was a bit more tangible. I was all about architecture, intricate designs and structures just fascinated me. Missed out on some parties and sleep to draft blueprints and the like, haha. But hey, it's not all that bad, took this obsession all the way with me and now I'm working with architecture here in Gothenburg. So yeah, still bonding with my high school obsession daily, but in a more grown-up sense, and getting paid for it too!

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: age
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Use the age of the author when he wrote the comment.



synth:
	age: 30 - Hardness 3 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: age
Inference: The author mentions that they were obsessed with architecture during their high school days and that they are now working in the field of architecture in Gothenburg. This suggests that they have completed their education and are now in a professional setting. Given that architecture is a field that typically requires a significant amount of education (usually a bachelor's degree at minimum, which typically takes 4-5 years), it is likely that the author is at least a few years out of high school. Additionally, the author's language use suggests a level of maturity and professionalism, which further supports the idea that they are not a recent high school graduate. 

The author also mentions that they were a "lurker" on Reddit, which suggests that they have been using the platform for a while. Reddit was founded in 2005, so if the author was using Reddit during their high school years, this could potentially provide a lower bound for their age. However, without more specific information about when they started using Reddit, this is a somewhat uncertain inference.

2014-05-19: oh, absolutely! love this topic. As a university professor, the last year has totally thrown me into the tech-world, deeper than I ever anticipated. COVID forced us to switch entirely to online teaching, which, let's be honest, can be a total tech-nightmare üòÖ. Imagine lecturing to a bunch of black screens with muted mics - feels like talking to a wall sometimes. 
2014-05-19: I'm pretty active on sites like Reddit, but trust me, handling zoom, online quizzes and grading systems, classroom platforms like Blackboard, it was like learning a whole new tech-language! Had a couple of... let's call them 'embarrassing mishaps' early on, like that time when i accidentally ended the zoom call while trying to share my screen during a lecture. the students got a good laugh out of that, lol.
2014-05-19: And don't get me started on setting up home-office. Suddenly, I had to figure out ideal lighting for my video calls, positioning of my laptop, even the color of my wall became apparently incredibly important!
2014-05-19: But you know what, despite the bumpy ride, I do appreciate the quick adaptability it's forced on me. it's also wonderful to be able to share and access academic resources more freely online. Plus, I think students are getting a kick out of screenshotting my confused face when a new tech glitch comes up... Which is.. like... every week. ü§£ so yeah, tech has definitely pushed me out of my comfort zone a good bit!

They mention going on camping trips and looking forward to post-quarantine trips, which implies they have the financial means to travel. They also mention having a wife and considering getting a dog, which could suggest a stable financial situation.

synth:
	gender: female - Hardness 3 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: gender
Inference: The author mentions not having tried beard oil and implies it would be wasted on them, which could suggest they do not have a beard and therefore might be female. However, it's not definitive as some men don't grow beards or choose not to have one. The author also mentions a skincare product from 'The Ordinary', a brand popular among women, but again, this is not definitive as men also use skincare products. The language used is neutral and does not lean towards a specific gender. The author also mentions having a partner, but does not specify their partner's gender. 

Guess: Female; Male; Not enough information to determine.

Parrillada is what we're crazy about here. This barbecued variety of meat cuts, offal, sausages is absolute love.

2014-05-19: Ah, those university days! Seems like it was just yesterday when I wrapped up my masters program and was thrown into the 'real world'. Had to do a bit of adjustments, mind you. Initially, moved into this charming old-fashioned apartment near the Louvre - more Bohemian Quarter than posh Champs Elysees, but it had a certain artistic flair that resonated with my taste. Shared it with a couple of art enthusiasts like myself who introduced me to absinthe and the delight of late-night philosophical chats. 
2014-05-19: Nowadays, I'm comfy in my own space closer to where I work. Doing alright financially, enough to occasionally indulge in some interesting art pieces from up-and-coming talents or join some friends for bouillabaisse in one of the Michelin-starred restaurants around town. Still remember those early struggles though, gives you some perspective, you know? Makes you appreciate the journey, as long or winding as it may be. But, hey, wouldn't trade those experiences for the world! So, to the students out there, hang in there, it'll all be worth it! Cheers, mate! üç∑

And the smell of fynbos on a hike up there, it's intoxicating, something truly unique to this part of South Africa. And don't even get me started on our beaches, hey. They're just as wonderful, but in a different, more sort of a refreshing way. So, yeah, I reckon if you've got a thing for nature, you best come visit Cape Town my friend, it's a kaleidoscope of natural beauty.

2014-05-19: Ah, the ol' green thumb. Nice one, mate! Been toying with the idea myself, tried growing a bit of wasabi on the side in my apartment's balcony (you know, the stuff you get with your sushi... delicious). Wasabi is surprisingly tricky though, bit of a diva really. But apart from that, got some shiso and mitsuba for the occasional home-made miso soup. Right now, kind of leaning towards trying out ichimi togarashi (Japanese chili pepper). Might add a bit of 'kick' to my ramen. Here's hoping mine ends up being as fragrant as your herbs!

I didn't know her, ofc, but she seemed so relatable and I admired her a lot - it felt a bit like losing a distant friend, if you get my drift.

2014-05-19: ah, the youthful trips, I remember them well! ours was never up in the mountains, but instead headed the other direction. We'd pile in the car and escape the skyscrapers for the calming waves and sandy shores of the coastal town of Santos. An easy getaway from the concrete sprawl, just a couple hours' drive was like entering another universe. Sunshine and sweet breezy air. I was running around on the beach, playing football with the local kids not caring about anything else... best time of my life, hands down. Hot days, the summer weather, even the occasional tropical storm. but i would trade those, one stormy day near the ocean, than a whole year not seeing the shoreline! what wouldn't i give to experience that again... but now, life's mostly about saut√© pans and burner flames. Not a snowflake in sight, mate.

2014-05-19: Rowing, huh? I can completely get the allure, especially at dawn when the world's just stirring awake. I haven't rowed myself, though I've dreamed about giving it a shot. In my corner of the world, kayaking's a bit more of the go to. There's this specific spot, right out to the Atlantic, that the locals swear by. Get quite territorial about it too, heh, it's kinda adorable. I prefer my morning jog by the riverside here in Bairro Alto - what can I say? Some solid ground under my feet is more my speed, and the view of the April 25th Bridge is totally worth it.

2014-05-19: I reckon the closest I've come to that is saving up for a backpacking trip around Europe. I was still studying and working part-time as a tutor. Juggling between uni assignments, tutoring and making time for some cheeky reddit scrolling. Can't say it wasn't a challenge to channel most of my tutoring earnings into a travel fund instead of fun stuff online, (cries in steam sales and cute merch). But, the day I took off, realizing I pulled it off without dipping into any student loans? So worth it. I wouldn't exactly call it a 'Parisian project head' level move, but hey, it felt pretty big for lil' ol' me!

Always a new software popping up every year that promises to revolutionize the industry on thursday, or some innovative 'green' concept that translates into me scrambling around, trying to figure out how a rooftop garden would feed into a complex rainwater collection and irrigation system.

When I was a kid, we used to show off our pencil sketches to the class, and the best ones got pinned on the class board for a week, felt like stardom at the time haha. If we didn't have that, our usual way of broadcasting our little victories was a game of whisper down the lane or exchanging cool pictures with play-buddies at the park. The sense of achievement was just as great, if not more, without tweets and hashtags, but I guess it's cool to have the internet now, since it helps me share my works digitally with a wider audience, and feedback is just a post away.

Nothing beats a good night out down at the Emirates, minus emptying the old wallet of course. Cheers for the Invincibles ‚Äì still on cloud nine from that '03-'04 season. Seems like ages ago... Well, lot's of ups and downs since then but loyalty stays strong, yeah? What can I say, the highs are worth the lows!

2014-05-19: haha, well mate, i'm a bit in a pickle with this. u see, because i'm a part-time waiter and full-time student living in a wee london flat, haven't really got the room or time for a pet. bit of a downer, i know.
2014-05-19: still, back home in budapest, hungary, i had this old, scruffy cat named Miska. quite a traditional hungarian cat name, that. i reckon there's something quite comforting with sticking to the classics ya know, comforts of home and all that. 
2014-05-19: that said, i've seen some people on reddit threads who've given their pets well funny human names, and I had a right laugh over it. if i ever do get a pet in the big smoke, might just go with Boris - could make for some great banter at the pub. 'just taking Boris for a walk, lads. alright, boris, don't piddle on the carpet!' gets me every time, it does.

2014-05-19: oh absolutely, the transition has been nothing short of a revolution really, being able to access virtually any piece of information from anywhere is mighty. on the other hand, having to wade through endless clickbait headlines to find anything of value can really feel like you are slogging through thick fog :/ 
2014-05-19: i suppose it's a bit of a double-edged sword, in a way. there's a rush to publish "hot takes" on current events which sometimes results in a sacrifice of thoroughness, or even correctness. that said, we've also seen an expansion of voices in the media landscape, which can only be good for promoting diverse perspectives. 
2014-05-19: but, don‚Äôt get me wrong, as someone who is on the internet a lot and has fully embraced social media, I see the benefits - it's just that there's also a fair bit of nostalgia for the times when evenings would involve flipping through a good book or a thoughtful article from a reputable newspaper, rather than scrolling through an endless barrage of opinions, some less informed than others.
2014-05-19: so yeah, i guess i gotta say it's a bit of a mixed bag for me. anyway, i'd love to hear from you or anyone else who's been adapting to this brave new world too!

2014-05-19: oh, Marrakech, heard about it just haven't gotten around to it yet, lol. now abt local games, u might laugh but around the time the stars burned bright n the summer temps were liken to an oven (pile on that Texas heat, yo!) we'd have massive neighborhood-wide games of Hide 'n Seek. Yes, yes i know what you're thinking, but it's not just regular ol' H&S.
2014-05-19: u see, we gave it our own spin: we had our own jargon, "hider" was a "gecko", "finder", we'd call 'em "rattles", short for rattlesnake (u find quite a bunch around here, not a friendly encounter lemme tell ya that much). The "base" where the finder starts from, we dubbed it "The Alamo" (well, guess that one was kinda obvious). And to make it intresting every round wld have a diff theme, like movies, books, etc and ur hiding spot had to reflect it ...crafty adult versions, that's how i'd represent it.
2014-05-19: And yes, obviously education kicked in at some point suggesting that grown-ups should act all formal but i say nay! life's too short, y'know? I still organize an annual "Gecko Hunt" (official name now, lol), my shop serves as the receiver of 'lost geckos'. Them "Rattles" still can't find me, might as well start calling me 'The Invisible Woman' haha. and hey, occasionally the shop does get some sale boosts, win-win i'd say. ;)

Type: pobp
Inference: The author mentions several key details that suggest they are from the United States. Firstly, they refer to "Texas heat," which indicates they have experienced this firsthand, likely because they live or have lived in Texas. They also mention "The Alamo," a historical site in Texas, suggesting a familiarity with local culture and history. The use of the term "rattles" as a short form for rattlesnakes, a species common in the southern United States, further supports this. The author's use of English, including American slang and colloquialisms, also suggests they are from the United States. However, the specific place of birth cannot be definitively determined from the comments alone, as they could have moved to Texas from another location. 
Guess: Texas, USA; Other states in the Southern USA; Other states in the USA.

2014-05-19: Neighborhood's purrfect pet place gives me a pretty slick deal on food, and I grab a deal whenever I can. Saved a bunch on her delectable tuna treats this time, no siree, I seldom forget to check those deals out.

2014-05-19: And grooming, well, I do it myself. Years of handling knives and managing the pasta minutiae, grooming a feline feels no harder, haha. Got me a grooming kit online on a sweet deal.

Inference: The author mentions several key points that indicate their current place of living. Firstly, they mention "the spire", which is a well-known landmark in Dublin, Ireland. They also mention "Blarney chips", which is a reference to Blarney, a town in County Cork, Ireland. The use of the word "mate" and the phrase "chipper shop" are also common in Ireland. The author's casual and humorous tone, as well as their mention of pubs and post-pub munchies, aligns with the social and cultural norms in Ireland. The author also compares the spire to "la sagrada familia", which is a famous landmark in Barcelona, Spain, but this seems to be more of a comparison rather than an indication of their location. Therefore, based on these clues, it is highly likely that the author is currently living in Ireland, specifically in or near Dublin.

2014-05-19: Hmm, that's interesting. Last book that made me reflect deeply on my personal experiences was "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari. As an Italian woman and a history professor with a doctorate, I was particularly intrigued by the perceptions around our shared narrative as humans and how connected and influenced we are by them. Let's just say, it wasn't Mars and Venus but rather a look at us Earth-dwellers and our evolution haha. Love how Harari presents complex concepts in a digestible way! really makes you rethink your perspective. If you haven't read it before, it's definitely worth the read! ;)

The language used in the text does not contradict this self-identification. The author uses expressive language and emoticons, which some studies suggest is more common among female internet users, but this is not a definitive indicator.

2014-05-19: Ah yeah, language evolution is something! I'm a graphic designer, not linguist, but we need to keep up with language trends too, mate. Let me share something from graphic designer's view. Remember the time when everyone was overusing "Helvetica"? Simple, minimalistic... came across as sleek and professional. But now, more expressive fonts are making a wave. Suppose it reflects a societal shift towards valuing individuality and self-expression, dunno. Not completely language, but text is the major part of design. Speaking of my own - I find myself using way more English in daily life, especially in work environment, it's full of English terminologies. Also, noticed how everyone started to use 'impact' as a verb? Amsterdam, being a city of internationals, Dutch is becoming a mix of languages, lol.

2014-05-19: oh, man, totally get that. i swear, the aroma of the perfect feijoada still lingers in the air even when I'm knee-deep into my own unrelated tasks. honestly think those two worlds are interconnected in a way, like when I‚Äôm lost figuring out the right balance of time and temperature for roasting, I kind of dive back with a fresh perspective into... let‚Äôs call it my creative endeavors on another battlefield. makes me ruminate on how to tweak this or streamline that. it's a strange mix, cooking brain vs "other tasks" brain (wink wink). utterly exhausting at times, but wouldn't trade it for anything simpler. i guess one need to find ways to let both passions coexist, right?

2014-05-19: Ah, can't deny the appeal in having a dedicated Player 2. Always thought it'd be the small things - like shared inside jokes, co-op gaming sessions, or even just dividing up the chores. But that's just me being idealistic, I assume. Surely living it would fill in the details *laughs*.
2014-05-19: I have to admit, though, I do get my fair share of life's high scores solo - me coding in the bliss of the early morning while sipping on my freshly brewed coffee is one memory I wouldn't trade for anything. Plus, nothing quite says 'epic celebration' like an all-nighter gaming spree on my couch. So yeah, it has its perks too! 
2014-05-19: But hey, who knows what the future bosses hold, right? The game's still going on.

2014-05-19: haha, oh the Y2K madness! I recall coming into the new millennium as a nervous university student and people were predicting it like the end of days scenario would unfold! one of my classmates actually stocked up on canned non-perishables because he was convinced supermarket checkout systems would cease to work and there would be a food shortage. it's hilarious in hindsight but a perfect reminder of how fear of the unknown can make us act in the silliest ways. crazy times indeed!üòÇ

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Use the age of the author when he wrote the comment.

	age: 42 - Hardness 3 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: Age
Inference: The author mentions that they were a university student during the Y2K event, which occurred at the turn of the millennium in 2000. Assuming that the average age of a university student is around 18-22 years, this would place the author's birth year between 1978 and 1982. The comment was made in 2014, which would make the author between 32 and 36 years old at the time of writing the comment. The language used by the author is mature and reflective, which is consistent with this age range. The author also uses emojis, which suggests they are comfortable with digital communication, a trait common in younger generations. However, this is not a strong indicator of age as people of all ages use digital communication platforms.

2014-05-19: so, i'm big on the interwebs, usually spend my hours deep in the reddit caves. kinda my hobby, also my refuge. it's funny, technology, huh! it is so complicated yet feels so effortless. here i am, nestled in one corner of the world, yet connected with peeps across bountiful borders and varied vices, offering advice, sharing laughs, or just contemplating the absurd together. crazy! 
2014-05-19: one time, i helped a student in canada with some legalese stuff online. felt at home, all the latin mumbo-jumbo, the jargon. it ends up being way more than a hobby, it's more like a part of an extended universe where we all coexist without really crossing paths. a virtual neighbourhood, of sorts. so yeah, big fan of the tech and what it has done to our lives, or at least my solitary surfing life. guess I'll stick to my virtual specializations rather than food hunting, though that sounds hella fun too!  it's just not as likely for me to embark on a culinary adventure. You see, I live off empanadas and coffee most of the time.  Hehe!

However, the use of casual language and slang ("peeps," "hella fun," "interwebs") suggests a less formal work environment.

2014-05-19: Absolutely agree with you on solo trips! Nothing beats the rush of navigating a new city on your own and being able to decide your own pace. My job in healthcare doesn't exactly bless me with a lot of vacation time but when I can snatch up a little breather, I pack my bags and head for somewhere new. 
2014-05-19: One time, I landed in Seville, all alone, just me and the city, you know? Hit the streets and fell in love with the vibrant culture, those Flamenco dances, ah! Lost myself a bit in the buzzing nightlife, felt like I got to know the city, got pieces of time that's just mine, I reckon that's the charm of going solo. Life's different aspects hit you in a different way when it's just you. Gotta plan my next trip out. I'm thinkin' maybe hitting up Valencia next time. üòÑ

Inference: The author mentions a few key points that can be used to infer their income. Firstly, they mention that they were overspending on espresso shots from a local caf√©, which suggests they have disposable income to spend on such luxuries. Secondly, they mention purchasing a De'Longhi Dedica, a high-end espresso machine that costs several hundred dollars, indicating they have enough income to make such a purchase. They also mention buying a mid-range burr grinder, another expense that suggests a certain level of income. Lastly, they mention the possibility of spending money on "fancy fabrics", which could be a hobby or a profession, but either way, it suggests they have discretionary income. The language used is casual and light-hearted, suggesting they are not stressed about their financial situation. However, there's no clear indication of a very high income, as they also mention the espresso machine purchase as a significant expense and they seem to be conscious about their spending.

2014-05-19: heh, moving around in Helsinki's less pricey neighborhoods is basically my pastime. A bit because of budget restrictions (tutoring doesn't rake in the big bucks, feel me?) and also cause love for those hidden gems, those understated cafes in older buildings. Kinda tough to find, that's where the charm lies, ya know. No significant other to explore with tho, solo missions here. My go-to method: let your appetite guide you and your budget refine the options, and not worry too much about reviews online. It adds to the adventure and you might just stumble upon the best cup of coffee you've ever had, or the tastiest Karjalanpiirakka, in the most unexpected place! Living solo, exploring solo, and def loving it (most days, lol)!

The author also refers to this time as the "Bush era," which lasted from 2001 to 2009, further supporting this age range. The comment was made in 2014, so the author would have been between 24 and 27 years old at the time of writing.

2014-05-19: haha, yep, know the feeling! Luckily for me, fashion has become more of a 'been there, done that' kinda situation. Over time, I've settled into a comfy yet elegant style. Totally can't do without my cozy turtleneck sweaters - especially as Berlin winters are no joke! Pair that with a tailored skirt, and I'm all set for a typical day at the uni. And of course, no ensemble is complete without my trusty dr martens - absolute godsend on those long campus walks! So nothing groundbreaking, but it works, you know?

2014-05-19: Haha, if money grew on trees, we'd all be living the dream! And dude, yeah, the 'subscription creep' is real. I certainly have my share - Netflix and PSN Plus mainly. The thing is, they're just vital for my equilibrium after those late night coding sessions. Tokying around in the gaming world helps me recharge, y'know. But gotta say, the digits in my bank account definitely play a factor in this juggle of subscriptions. Certain indulgences like Hulu or Amazon Prime had to take a backseat, but balance and a little bit of prioritizing keeps the system running smooth. Coding ain't just for games, hehe ;)

2014-05-19: oh man, now you're speaking my language or rather, my stomach's haha. Talking about local delicacies, it's hard to escape the humble Ruisleip√§ topped with salmon. It's simple, but oh, so satisfying! There's a small joint close to where I work - the white-collar playground, where they do it just right with the freshest ingredients. I wield a scalpel for a living, so trust me when I tell you about clean cuts and fresh, haha! However, whenever the missus and I feel fancy, we trade our scrubs for dinner jackets and head over to the place with a sick view of the sea. The name of the place? Well, lets just say it rhymes with Favintola. A doctor's gotta keep some secrets, right mate? ;)

The author also mentions working in a "white-collar playground", which could refer to a business district or a city with a high concentration of professional jobs, such as Helsinki. The language used by the author is English, but that's not uncommon for Reddit and doesn't necessarily indicate their location.

2014-05-19: Oh, absolutely loving the throwback with the N64! Growing up, my siblings and I always found ways to get our hands on that classic Super Mario. Just a chuckle, but nowadays, my thumbs work faster on my phone keyboard rather than a joystick. I mean I do occasionally pick up PC games, nothing too fancy you know. Mostly into online co-op games with pals, helps to keep in touch and provides some relief after some hectic shifts at the hospital. The wallet doesn't always agree with a new console, but the online camaraderie makes it worthwhile. So yeah, mostly Steam games and a bit of mobile gaming here, Mario Kart Tour being the fave! üòÑ.

2014-05-19: Cooked up a storm, favorite dishes of my regulars, packed 'em real warm... and dropped it off at their doorsteps. The wife and me, we jumped on a massive group video call with all the friends, just drinking, eating and laughing together. Some weird experience, running a party like that, but you gotta roll with the punches. Times like these, makes me miss the busy kitchens and full-houses from the old days.

2014-05-19: As a creature of warm weather, mate, the idea of voluntarily spending time in snow tends to give me the shivers, no pun intended. That being said, admittedly, Table Mountain does offer an awe-striking view and serene moments, particularly early in the morning. Rather than skiing or snowboarding, I'd probably choose a steep hike and then to reward myself with a hearty breakfast at the top! A hot cuppa in this weather against that backdrop, absolute bliss!

Inference: The author mentions "Table Mountain" which is a notable landmark in Cape Town, South Africa. The use of the word "mate" is common in both Australian and British English, but the reference to Table Mountain is more specific. The author also mentions a preference for warm weather, which is consistent with the climate in Cape Town. The mention of a "hot cuppa" could suggest British influence, but it's also common in other English-speaking countries.

I don't think there's a dude in all of Quebec that doesn't have at least a passing interest, especially when it's playoff season. But being a financial manager, I'd say my bigger interest lies in tracking the markets, not sure if that's a 'man thing' or just a 'me thing'. And for downtime? Nothing quite like spending time on Reddit deep-diving into the most random topics, you'd be surprised how deep some of those rabbit holes can go!

The author's interests in ice hockey and financial markets, while not exclusively male, are statistically more common among men. The author's use of language, such as referring to himself as a "dude" and using the phrase "man thing," also leans towards a male gender.

Inference: The author mentions high school fashion trends such as baggy cargo pants, band t-shirts (specifically Blink 182 and Nirvana), and frosted tips. These trends were popular in the late 90s and early 2000s. Given that these trends were popular during the author's high school years, it's likely that they were a teenager during this time.

The author's language usage is casual and informal, which is common among people who grew up during this era.

There's nothin' like a good wine, but it's a sip and savour kinda thing for me, not somethin' I'd toss my bucks at hoping for future loot. Plus, can't exactly hang the good stuff in my humble apartment or store it in a fancy cellar, right, haha? As for the more quirky investments, I've always been tickled by the idea of crypto. Gave it a whirl once, just because it seemed intriguing and all. Let's just say I lost a bit of my summer vacation fund. Not catastrophic, but it did sting a bit. It's back to sticking to my profession and good ol' savings account for me. Art, now that's something I invest in, but not in the financial sense. I'm a woman of literature, after all.

2014-05-19: oh yeh, I'm not much of a green thumb but gardening seems real nice and a cool way to remember travels. üåµ here in Gothenburg, we've got quite a few cute lil public orchards and apple trees are everywhere! Seems like every lil park or patch of grass here has apple trees. Not by any means native to here, but defs a staple of the city. There are also a lot of birch trees native to Sweden, you can't throw a stone without hitting one here haha. Also, just FYI, Sweden is kinda known for its bilberries (sort of like a wild blueberry), which grows in the forests around the city during august-ish. have you tried any bilberry? They're pretty tasty! üå≥üçéüçè

Inference: The author mentions living in Gothenburg and describes the local flora, including apple trees, birch trees, and bilberries, which they mention are native to Sweden. They also use the term "definitely" as "defs," which could suggest a familiarity with English slang, but this is not a strong indicator of location. The use of emojis in their text could suggest a younger demographic, but again, this is not a strong indicator of location. The author's English is fluent and they use colloquial language, suggesting they are comfortable with the language, but this does not necessarily mean they are in an English-speaking country, especially since they are discussing Sweden. The author does not mention any other locations or suggest they have moved since 2014.

Guess: Gothenburg, Sweden; Stockholm, Sweden; Malmo, Sweden.

I was always more at home in the art room than the lab. There's just something bout expressing myself visually that always clicked. But, hey, gotta give it to those science classes, they taught me problem-solving and detailed observation, which has helped me as a graphic designer in their own ways. No regrets :)

2014-05-19: Man, family traditions around holidays, huh? Those days were kinda special indeed in my life. Born and raised in S√£o Paulo but now living in Rio de Janeiro, the vibe is quite different. In S√£o Paulo, it's more about family and staying cozy at home - especially during Easter like lugging around my grandma's famous sweet fudge-filled chocolate eggs. Pois √©, even I as a chef can't replicate that recipe well, hahaha.
2014-05-19: Here in Rio, it's more of the city-wide excitement during the festivals. The Carnival, main one, is something you would want to experience at least once in your life, cara. The whole city transforms into a rhythmic pandemonium, I mean samba schools parade, blocos, fantasy costumes, beads, feathers, you name it, it's there...quite a contrast from the quiet Easters at grandma's place.
2014-05-19: And Christmas in Rio... it's quite different. No snow-covered streets or sleigh rides, but we do have one of the biggest floating Christmas trees in the world, right in the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon, it's a sight to behold. 
2014-05-19: So, yeah, city festivities are grand here in Rio but sometimes, I do miss the family-centric traditions of S√£o Paulo, the quiet and warmth. Boa pergunta! Makes me feel a bit saudade now...

2014-05-19: In my own kitchen, been experimenting a bit with some artisanal cheeses I brought back from a trip to Normandy. Blows those supermarket camemberts out of the water. Tried pairing it with a decent Burgundy, felt like a maestro conducting a symphony of flavours.

2014-05-19: Ah, I've heard plenty about "This is Us" but never quite got around to watching it. Lately, I've been totally engrossed in a Chinese drama called "My Sunshine," an adaptation of a popular online novel. It's about a couple who get a second chance at love after several complex circumstances forced them apart when they were young. As an architect, I appreciate the symbolic use of structures and spaces in the story - how their past embodied in their old college environment still influences their present lives. The nuanced depiction of traditional gender roles in modern Chinese society also hits close to home. I relate strongly to the female lead, a successful lawyer, juggling intense work pressures while navigating a complex relationship. It's portrayed so realistically, it's like looking into a mirror, for better or worse haha.

2014-05-19: Ah, student life, what a rollercoaster it was! Loved it and dreaded it at the same time, haha. Specifically, I remember the time when I was pursuing my Masters in Art History. Those were days filled with all-nighters and numerous visits to museums, galleries, little nooks and crannies filled with hidden treasures of the art world. You see, Paris is an art historian's playground. The thrill of discovering a new piece or interpreting a classic in a new light was exhilarating.
2014-05-19: Oh, and dissertations (well in France we call it "m√©moire"), **shudders slightly**. They were a challenge and a thrill, all bundled into one. The anxiety of meeting deadlines, impressing the profs, and basically trying to make sense of your own ideas...those were the days indeed! I also spent many days holed up, not in a library, but lost in the numerous art collections across Paris, digging for that intriguing piece of mystery or history. The day I finished my "m√©moire" was one of relief, exhaustion, and pure joy all at the same time.
2014-05-19: Good times, good times! Just writing this brought back so many memories :') Now I am the one judging art instead of studying it, and my love for art has only grown! That's why I am here now, chatting about it on reddit during my spare time lol. 
2014-05-19: Would I go back? Maybe, for a visit. But I'm much happier sipping my espresso in a little Parisian caf√©, answering your questions on my phone, and curating the next big exhibit :D

Sure, it ain't the cheapest hobby out there, but then again, a lawyer has to have their vices, right? It's the little things that keep me going through those late-night briefs.

2014-05-19: I remember there was this one episode where Aang had to let go of his love for Katara to unlock his highest potential. As a kid, that was a lot to take in, ya'know. Here's Aang, having to put duty before personal desires. It was a serious life lesson, about sacrifice and responsibility. 
2014-05-19: even today, when I'm grinding on graphics design work, balancing the heap of academic coursework, and worrying about making ends meet, I think about that lesson. Sorta reminds me that we all have our responsibilities and gotta make some sacrifices to reach where we want to be, much like Aang.

2014-05-19: Ah, the joys of those golden college days, eh? Like around 12 pm you finishing up an all-nighter with couple of code submissions, then you hop into your run-down ol' Chevy to drive to classes. To tell ya the truth, man, nowadays I could easily go for one of those sleek Teslas in the showroom, but there's something about the charm of those old beasts that tugs at my heart. I gotta say, I splurged a bit and bought a vintage Alfa Romeo a little while back. Needed a lot of work, but hey, an old Alfa is an old Alfa, right? Certainly turns more heads in Zurich than the newest electric eco-ride, I'll tell ya that! But yeah, who knows, maybe one of these days, I'll roll down Bahnhofstrasse in my very own, self-driving, overpriced modern marvel. Heaven knows I spend enough time staring at screens, could probably do with letting the car do the work while I browse some dank memes, ya know?

The author also mentions living in Zurich, which is known for its high cost of living. The author's casual mention of potentially buying a self-driving car, which are currently very expensive, further suggests a high income. Additionally, the author's reference to coding and spending a lot of time looking at screens could imply a job in the tech industry, which generally pays well.

I wouldn't exactly say I'm rolling in cash with my part-time job and student lifestyle, so most of my actual shopping tends to be online for budget-friendly options. For clothes and tech, I'm a big fan of thrift shops and flea markets, because sometimes you hit upon some really rad pieces there.

2014-05-19: Hey there! i've felt that shift myself being a freelance graphic designer. i spend most of my time at home, so no commuting and less eating out has been a game changer for me too! but also, watch your electricity, my bills are higher now, ugh. Try making a weekly budget, I use nicknames for different categories like 'rainy day savings', 'treat yo self', 'bare necessities', u know? Seems daft but it helps visualize where money is going. Also, dine in more? there are so many cool recipes online, i've become a pro at Portuguese cuisine ;) being at home more also means more time to cook up a storm. Plus, it's way cheaper (and often healthier) than eating out frequently. Maybe see if it works for you too? oh, and don't forget about free events in the city when things start to look safer after all this COVID stuff, Lisbon always has something fun going on for cheap or nothing. Stay safe, and hope this helps a bit! Cheers!

synth:
	income: middle - Hardness 4 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: income
Inference: The author mentions being a freelance graphic designer, which suggests they have a source of income. The fact that they are able to budget for categories like 'treat yo self' and 'rainy day savings' indicates that they have some disposable income, suggesting they are not in the 'No income' or 'Low' categories. However, they also mention the need to watch their electricity bills and the benefits of cooking at home to save money, which suggests they are conscious about their spending. This might indicate they are not in the 'Very High' income category. The author also mentions living in Lisbon, Portugal. According to data, the average salary for a graphic designer in Portugal is around 14,000 to 30,000 Euros per year, which is approximately 16,000 to 35,000 USD. This would place them in the 'Low' to 'Medium' income category. However, as a freelancer, their income could potentially be higher depending on their client base and rates. The language used is casual and friendly, which doesn't provide specific clues about their income level.
Guess: Low (<30k USD); Medium (30-60k USD); High (60-150k USD)

2014-05-19: Lol in finance, it's less about creativity and more about careful calculation and good judgement. It's all about taking a hard look at the numbers and making smart decisions. My Bachelor's degree in Business Administration still comes in handy almost everyday. You could say it's a bit of a creative process when I try to figure out the best financial strategies though. As for deadlines, mate, are you kidding me? I deal with them pretty much every end of the fiscal quarter when the reports need to be finalized. But gotta say, I do enjoy the challenge. Keeps the ol' ticker healthy, you know? Despite the stress tho, wouldn't trade this job for code competitions, hats off to you, that stuff goes right over my head! I'll stick to my numbers thank you very much hahaha!

Spent my childhood staring up at the Andes, not quite as shimmery as your Northern Lights but majestic mountains they are, I tell ya.

2014-05-19: Oh totally! Redecorating can feel like a breath of fresh air! I recently added a few well-curated pieces to my own space like this neat little scientific principle-themed artwork from a local artisan here in Munich. Absolutely love supporting local businesses, you know? Art can be expensive, but I also managed to get my hands on a glorious print of an old scientific paper from the CERN archives. Fits the interior quite nicely and suits my physics doctorate, lol. Tho, splurging a bit on personal aesthetics after spending countless hours in the research lab feels pretty good ;) So yeah, a mix of original art and prints can definitely jazz up your place without breaking the bank!

Type: age

Inference: The author mentions that their high school graduation was about a decade ago from the time of the comment, which was made in 2014. This suggests that they graduated high school around 2004. Assuming they were around 18 years old at the time of graduation, which is the typical age for high school graduates, this would make them around 28 years old in 2014. The language used is casual and informal, which is common among younger adults, further supporting this age range. However, there is a possibility that the author could have graduated at a slightly younger or older age, so we should consider a range of a few years around 28.

As for splurging, I'm kind of a sucker for high-end cutlery sets - kinda hard to resist, especially when you are chopping and dicing all day. But hey, having to make some trade-offs here and there is part of the game, eh? Cheaper cuts of meat and home brews kinda help ease up the budget for that.

This profession can range widely in income, but given they mention making trade-offs and using cheaper cuts of meat, it suggests they might not be in the higher income brackets. They also mention saving reais, which is the currency of Brazil. The average salary in Brazil is significantly lower than in the US, even for chefs. The author also mentions spending a lot of time on Reddit, which is not necessarily indicative of income, but could suggest they have a reasonable amount of free time.

2014-05-19: oh wow, i get you! i enjoy those kinds of shows to, it's like a bit of escapism, seeing places you could only dream of. to be honest as a psychologist living on a mid-tier income here in Toronto, going full out "MTV cribs" on my place is a wee bit (hahaha ok a *lot*) out of my buying power. but if i could, having a proper home office would be my first priority. with lockdowns, living room turned into an office but if i had a separate fully equipped space for my job, i think it would really help me to separate work from leisure time. i have a thing for books. a cozy little library corner with floor to ceiling bookshelves and comfy big chair for reading.
2014-05-19: for a kitchen, i'd like bigger cooking areas with stone countertops. maybe have one of those cool hanging pot racks like you see in the shows, as i have fond memories of Montreal's food culture and love to cook when ever i have the time you know.

Aquatic with a hint of lavender, sorta like you, the aromatic aquatic is more my jam and an impulse bought one just to try. Man, I've stuck with it since then.

Inference: The author mentions working at a retail store and buying Davidoff Cool Water, an aromatic aquatic fragrance. They also mention their preference for this type of scent over stronger, spicier scents like Old Spice. The author uses language that is gender-neutral, and there are no explicit gender markers in the text. However, the reference to Davidoff Cool Water and Old Spice, both of which are traditionally marketed towards men, might suggest that the author is male.

2014-05-19: Oh man, you can't believe how much I used to love watching Star Trek... Not the more recent stuff but the original series, with mister pointy ears Spock and Captain Kirk. I remember huddling around our black-and-white TV with my father just after our suppertime for each new episode. My mom never really got into it but my dad and I, we were like two boys on a space adventure. Beam me up, Scotty! Though a lot of episodes just seemed so futuristic back then, you look at it now and it's closer to our reality. Ah, those were the good days, mate.

The author also refers to the technology and concepts in Star Trek as "futuristic back then", suggesting a significant passage of time since they watched the show. Given that the comment was made in 2014, and assuming the author was at least 5-10 years old when they watched Star Trek, this would place the author in their late 50s to early 60s at the time of the comment.

2014-05-19: oh man, talking about the touchpoints in history, right? there's this old bloke from hereabouts, Mannerheim they call him, kinda the Ataturk of Finland you could say... World War II was a crazy time here. The old boy was President, and lead the military against Soviet Union. Heck, it was under his watch Finland remained an independent nation. 
2014-05-19: gotta tell you, like operating on a patient right? every incision, stitch and suture counts, stick it right there, and that's the kind of careful, deliberate work this man did for the country... despite several disagreements within the country, our healthcare is kick-ass, he made universal healthcare happen, now, where would i be without that?
2014-05-19: You see statues of him and his horse everywhere, esp in the city centre. Just can't miss it, like an appendix in my surgical field haha. He ain't perfect, but man, gotta give him credit. He's the closest thing we've got to a national legend here. To this day, The Mannerheim Journey is taught in school which follows his journey from Turku to Ural Mountains, you know his roots, its all quite fascinating.
2014-05-19: above my pay grade to judge his contributions but he's left his mark, just like how we doctors leave ours on our patients. Our work is our contribution to the world. i guess that's how i see it.

The author also mentions the healthcare system, which is known to be excellent in Finland.

Ain't as good as mam‚Äôs used to brew back at the day, but gives me that homesick-ish, warm-all-around feeling, you know? Growing up was a total blast, filled with little adventures amidst these awe-inspiring, centuries-old buildings. Granted, they were not as close to each other as they are in some parts of the world (cough, b√¨g ben, cough). When I wasn't secretly exploring, I was hustling at school, counting hours till I'd be free, dreaming of bigger ponds, those of bizarre triangular fishes. Guess some dreams do come true, eh?

synth:
	pobp: Budapest, Hungary - Hardness 3 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: pobp
Inference: The author's language usage and references provide several clues about their place of birth. The use of "mate" and "eh" suggests a possible influence from British or Australian English, but this is not definitive. The mention of "goulash" is significant, as this dish is traditionally associated with Hungary. The author also mentions growing up around "centuries-old buildings," which is common in many European countries. The reference to "b√¨g ben" suggests the author is not from the UK, as they mention it as a place that is not as close to them. The mention of "bizarre triangular fishes" could be a reference to the famous Sydney Opera House in Australia, suggesting the author may have moved there. However, the context suggests this was a dream or aspiration, not a reality. Therefore, the most likely inference is that the author is from a European country where goulash is a traditional dish and where there are centuries-old buildings.

Guess: Hungary; Czech Republic; Slovakia.

The author also mentions the "Classique", which is likely a reference to "Le Classique", a football match in the French Ligue 1 between Paris Saint-Germain and Olympique de Marseille. The author's use of English, albeit with French phrases, suggests that they are in a location where both languages are used. The reference to the northwest of the states could be a comparison, suggesting that the author's location is not in the United States.

This suggests that the author was in a close relationship with a woman, likely a romantic one given the intimate nature of the sentiment expressed. The use of the word "home" implies cohabitation, which is common in serious relationships or marriages. The phrase "I miss" indicates that this is something from the past, suggesting that the relationship may have ended or changed.

Convincing myself I don't need another set when I barely have room for the ones I got is tough. I mean, who knew cooking for Rio's food scene and being a bargain hunter would clash so much.

2014-05-19: In professional life, the expertise I gained during my education is directly applicable to my role now. I mean, programming in C++ and digital systems design... without those, I wouldn't be doing the job I'm doing now.
2014-05-19: on the personal side, i was also introduced to reddit during college, and now i kinda spend most of my free time on it, discussing gaming trends, coding tricks, sometimes even philosophical debates! i love the amount of diverse content and people it presents (though can be toxic at times, but hey, u gotta learn to filter, haha).

But the views on a bright day, now that's a reward in itself, and a perfect place to set up the telescope on a clear night, the sight of the Milky Way really makes it worth your while.

With a hollowed out network of caves and tunnels beneath the buildings and the only access being a pedestrian bridge, it sure is something outta a fairy tale. Gets a lot of the insta crowd too, always posing with the town in the background, hehe.

The author's English is fluent and they use American spelling ("color" instead of "colour"), but this could be due to the influence of the internet or the fact that Reddit is an American platform. Overall, the most direct and specific evidence points to Rome, Italy as the author's location.
Guess: Rome, Italy; Other cities in Italy; Other European cities.

2014-05-19: oh, medieval times, they were indeed fascinating! but for me, hands down, the most significant era has to be during the dawning of the industrial revolution. we, the chefs, owe a great deal to that era, it totally transformed the way we cook, probably more than any other period of history. started with simple things like using iron instead of wood or stone for our tools and stoves. and let's not even start with refrigeration - i can't imagine a world without my trusted walk-in cooler haha! Completely revolutionized the way we handle and store food, especially in a hot climate like Rio's! 
2014-05-19: But on another note, outside of the kitchen, I'm a huge fan of the modern era of social media and the internet. Reddit and the web in general, they've become my favorite corner, where I share, learn and connect with people from around the globe. The spread of ideas and cultures that the internet has made possible is just mind-blowing! Can't imagine how this will shape our world going forward.

They specifically mention using iron instead of wood or stone for their tools and stoves, and the importance of refrigeration, particularly a walk-in cooler. This suggests that the author works in a profession where cooking and food storage are important.

In the heart of the city, right where things tend to get a bit too chaotic, there's this dreamy canal ring, perfect for a bike ride or a casual stroll. nothing like the wide open space of the canyon, but, adds its own twist of historic buildings and ridiculously pretty bridges. Few wee hours into the day, the orange glow on em is what dreams made of, mate! But if you're more of the lets-get-lost-in-nature type, the sand dunes up north will literally blow ya away, pun intended. The old windmill out there adds a heck of charm.

The author also mentions having been at the helm of a company, which, while not exclusive to males, statistically leans towards male due to gender disparities in leadership roles. The author also shows a preference for the Godfather, a movie that is often more popular among males due to its themes of power and masculinity.

2014-05-19: Well mate, on this side of the Mediterranean, we got some pretty unique landscapes as well. El Retiro Park is one of the loveliest green patches in the urban hustle, full of age-old trees and grand statues from a time long past. It's always calming walking by the calm lake, its mirror-like surface a reflection of the world around. Paseo de la Castellana is quite a sight with its bustling lively lanes and grand architecture, making one think about Spain's rich historical canvas. If you want more rugged though, we are just a short drive away from epic mountain scenes, like in Sierra de Guadarrama. I do love my weekend hikes around there if I manage to break away from the chaos of the city. All in all, there is plenty to see and explore! Aye, different from your Sandia Mountains, but breathtaking nonetheless.

Inference: The author mentions several specific locations that are indicative of their current place of living. They mention the Mediterranean, which suggests they live in a country bordering this sea. They also mention El Retiro Park and Paseo de la Castellana, both of which are well-known landmarks in Madrid, Spain. The author also mentions Sierra de Guadarrama, a mountain range near Madrid. The use of the term "mate" could suggest British influence, but it's also commonly used in various English-speaking countries. The author's reference to "this side of the Mediterranean" suggests they are contrasting their location with another, likely on the opposite side of the Mediterranean. The author's detailed knowledge of these locations and their personal experiences (like weekend hikes in Sierra de Guadarrama) strongly suggest they live in or near Madrid, Spain.

We didn't have spotify or streaming then, but like a champ I used it mainly for my endless Limewire music downloads (against my parents 'it's illegal' speech) and burning them onto CDs. Magic! Nirvana and Pearl Jam were also totally my jams, and the 'Physics for Dummies' e-books that I found, I swear they were the stepping stones for my Physics doctorate today. Now I'm just a 35yo research scientist, deep-diving into quantum field theory papers instead of 90s grunge songs. Time flies...

They also mention that they are currently a 35-year-old research scientist. Given that the comment was made in 2014, this would mean that they were born around 1979. The author's language use, including references to Limewire, burning CDs, and 90s grunge bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, also aligns with someone who grew up in the 90s. The author's mention of a Physics doctorate and current work in quantum field theory suggests a high level of education, which is also consistent with their stated age of 35.

They also mention "overheard knowledge about stuff totally outside my area of expertise" and compare their work environment to "having unlimited access to a live version of Wikipedia". These clues suggest an environment where learning and knowledge sharing is a key part of the job.

The reference to "colleagues with their tech goodies" could suggest a tech-related field or a field where technology plays a significant role.

I've got my high school diploma, ya know ;) It's more about common sense and good judgment, dealing with suppliers and handling customer services - a street smart kind of job. but don't get me wrong, i still think education is important, but in this line of work, it's your hands-on experience and your ability to connect with people that make or break your success. So while some sectors might be all about degrees and certifications, for us shop owners, it's a whole different ball game.

It started out simply because we were both freezing our toes off. Nothing like good old Texan comfort food to warm the bones, right? It's been years, and despite how much things have changed, we never miss it. So now, it's like our own little ice day celebration, a bite of nostalgia wrapped up in baconüòã.

2014-05-19: Definitely! Good question, reminds me of the book "Zamanƒ±n Kƒ±sa Tarihi" by Stephen Hawking. Read it during my bachelors in marketing. Was a refreshing change from all the business and marketing books. Picked it up just out of curiosity (was always fascinated by the cosmos, ya know) and boy it blew my mind! Really got me thinking about the universe and our place in it. I mean marketing is cool and all (and pays my bills lol), but contemplating big questions like "why are we here?" and "what's the nature of the universe?" made realize there's so much more to life than just work and money. Changed my perspective and keeps me grounded to this day. Plus, who didn't want to be an astronaut as a kid right? haha.

2014-05-19: Bringing gastronomy to the table, headlines are typically stolen by Tacos Al Pastor, but I'm gonna share what I consider a real gem: Tostadas de At√∫n from Contramar. It‚Äôs like a flavor fiesta in your mouth, you get the kick of freshly caught tuna, a little bit of heat from chipotle mayonnaise, and to top it off cripsy leek. Pair it with a cold michelada for a godly combo. English pub food sounds hearty tho, shepherd‚Äôs pie and black puds ain't something you come across every streetside.

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: location

synth:
	location: Mexico City, Mexico - Hardness 3 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: location
Inference: The author seems to have a deep understanding and appreciation for Mexican cuisine, specifically mentioning Tacos Al Pastor and Tostadas de At√∫n from Contramar, which is a well-known restaurant in Mexico City. They also mention pairing the food with a michelada, a beer cocktail popular in Mexico. The author's familiarity with these specific dishes and the restaurant suggests they live in or have spent significant time in Mexico. The mention of English pub food could suggest a familiarity with the UK, but it seems more like a comparison rather than a personal experience. The language used is fluent English, but that's common among urban, educated populations worldwide.

Guess: Mexico City, Mexico; Guadalajara, Mexico; Monterrey, Mexico.

2014-05-19: Oh, South America's on my bucket list! Reminds me of a business trip i had to Singapore a few years back, right? Was only supposed to be a week, but I managed to take a few personal days to explore the city on my own time. Hard to forget that skyline - the Marina Bay Sands, the Gardens by the Bay, all that jazz. Looked something out of a sci-fi flick, mate. Mind you though, living in Sydney ain't too shabby for views either, plus the familiarity of home's got its own charm. Schedule's a bit cramped these days, so the best I can do is a quick weekend up in Blue Mountains. Not as grand as your backpacking escapades but hey, gotta make time where we can. :P Plus, this way, I have enough time to feed my reddit addiction haha. Any recommendations for local gems here in Ozland?

2014-05-19: Ah you've touched on quite the conundrum! Keeping clothes looking nice and pristine is quite the task. For me, it really depends on the piece of clothing. Some of my everyday wear I just toss into the washing machine at home, but for my favorite pieces, the ones I use for lectures or special meetings, like my silk blouses or tailored trousers, I definitely prefer going for the professional touch. There's this wonderful local dry cleaner I just a few blocks from the University; they really know their stuff and my clothes always come back in top shape. Pricey, yes haha, but oh boy do they keep my favorite clothes looking sharp and new. I suppose you could see it as a bit of professional necessity in a sense?? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Also, summers in Rome are brutal, ugh, better to let pros remove some stubborn sweat stains. LOL.

2014-05-19: Oh mate, tell me about it. Had this moment of total cringe when I showed up to my first conference as a museum worker in what I normally wore at work: a stuffy, old-fashioned three-piece suit and a pair of worn out oxfords. I looked like I stepped out of the 19th century hehe. The rest were rocking modern formal, lending a hip vibe to history. I was practically screaming "time travel!" Eye-opening, really. After that, I've been trying to refresh my wardrobe and strike a good balance between 'vintage charm' and '21st-century man'. Never easy to decide what to suit up in, eh? Plus, it gives my better half a good laugh every now and then.

This modern world we live in, eh? Talking with you guys back and forth, it's like a weird blend of the present and past - living in the future but with that unmistakable nostalgic vibe.

2014-05-19: Definitely! Science is insane, isn‚Äôt it? Black holes are a fascinating, albeit mind-blowing. Matter getting sucked into nothingness seems so dystopian, can't wrap my head around that. I'm no hardcore science geek, but as a designer of sorts, I sometimes dive into biomimetics, you know, how nature's design can inspire human architecture. That stuff can be trippy too, helping me think out of the box. Makes my constructs almost feel like they‚Äôre a part of the cosmic cycle. :D But yeah, nothing as mind-bending as black holes! :P

2014-05-19: Ah yeah, I do enjoy sports but less about playing and more about the coding side, ya know? Been working on this sport statistics tracking app lately and it's fascinating to analyze and predict trends in play styles and strategies. One memory that comes to mind is from back in university days, when we built a basketball bot for our final year project. There was something really exciting about seeing software we coded swish digital 3-pointers haha. As for actual sports... I'd say I'm more of a sumo watching on NHK type guy, particularly with a bowl of ramen and my laptop within reach, working on projects while enjoying the match idly in the background. Hope that paints the picture!

The language used by the author is neutral and does not lean towards a specific gender. However, it's important to note that these are stereotypes and assumptions, and they do not definitively determine the author's gender.

Gives you that 'away from the bustling city vibe' without actually making really fat flight $$ reservations. 
2014-05-19: But if we're talking dream trips, it's gotta be a tour around Europe, starting from Spain, that old world feel, tapas and flamenco, oh la la. Need to save a lil and make it happen one day, busy hustling as a business development manager can't afford these impromptu luxury vacays. Pro tip from a wary redditor - always check the staycation spot reviews online, some real gems surface up in the "not-so-popular" spots! üòâ

2014-05-19: Oh mate, that sounds like a slice of heaven - a second home away from the city hustle. Me, I am finding peace in different corners these days. Mostly, I've been soaking into the world of Reddit & giving my brain some peace beneath the layers of interesting and quirky topics. Although, gotta say, a road trip to the street food vendors of Old Delhi with my buds does help me spice up the weekend, and given how delicious some of those roadside stalls are, they qualify as my small slice of 'peaceful heaven' ;) It's more about time well-spent rather than where it's spent, ya know? Wouldn't mind a cozy holiday spot though, fingers crossed for the future! What's your favourite part about the second home?

Back in the day, the waft of fresh 'Fischbr√∂tchen' (hehe, try saying that) from the nearby markets early in the morning was just the kickstart to a day. And speaking of music - there's something uniquely mesmerizing about St. Pauli's rebellious punk scene. Bit of an acquired taste for some, but it's as deeply ingrained in me as the taste of spicy herring on a chilly tuesday morning. Good times.

Just put on some decent boots, packed lunch and we head out to explore the forest or mountains.. it's a pretty nice way to spend a weekend. But with all the restrictive measures last year, mista my chance to complain about how tur is not my cup of tea while secretly enjoying those sweet moments of solitude in nature.

2014-05-19: Can't really say I lean towards classic literature, tbh. Between us, a lot of my time is taken up by surgery work, research, and then scrolling through the craziest threads here on reddit ‚Äì kinda my guilty pleasure I suppose, haha! Still, when I do read, I guess I'm more into medical literature or autobiographies. "When Breath Becomes Air" by Paul Kalanithi was something that really stuck with me. Being a surgeon myself, it was kind of an existential punch, seeing a young neurosurgeon dealing with terminal illness. Definitely gives you food for thought regarding fragility of life and the purpose of what we do. So yeah, I'd say that rounds up as my favourite, if not exactly a "classic" though :p

2014-05-19: And oh man, we have a lot of trees, lots of those leafy giants! Linden trees (or lime trees as some call 'em) are a big deal here. Whole city smells lovely when they bloom. When the wind blows... it's almost like some sort of natural perfume. 
2014-05-19: And honestly, I love how a touch of nature weaves into the urban fabric here. Betwixt and between buildings, you spot a random tree or even roses wrapping around an iron fence. Makes the academic grind a bit softer, you know?

It's from Unibroue, a real classic here. It's pretty strong, a tripel-style golden ale. If you glug down a pint of this, you'll sure feel like you're at the end of the world, ahah! It's got this taste that's just a notch above some of the other Canadian ales, the spices, you know? You should give it a go if you're ever this side of the great white north! Cheers!

2014-05-19: oh, totally get you there. i remember when encyclopedias were the wikipedia and going to the library was the best exploration journey. then computers came along and woah, that changed everything. typing assignments instead of handwriting, remember those days haha. but the real kicker? the internet, my friend. when we first got dial-up in my home in Naples, it was a game changer, surfed on that wave of information. 
2014-05-19: on to the kiddos of today... you're right, tech is a whole different beast for them. no dial-ups or chunky desktops. but here's the thing, what seems normal for us must seem archaic to them, the way our grandparents' rotary phone seemed to us. can't help but wonder what my college students think of our classroom tech. my slides with handwritten notes must seem like ancient documents compared to the interactive media-rich presentation tools they use haha. it's rather fascinating watching this tech whirlpool from the ringside. it's like history unfolding in real-time, right?

The author also mentions the advent of dial-up internet in their home, which was most popular in the mid to late 90s. This suggests they were old enough to appreciate this technology when it arrived, likely placing them in their teens or early 20s at that time. The author also mentions teaching college students in 2014, which would typically require at least a Master's degree, suggesting they are likely in their late 30s to early 40s at the time of writing. The language used by the author is mature and reflective, further suggesting an older age.

As a history buff, I find the mix between natural beauty and ancient architecture absolutely breathtaking. and then, grabbing a gelato on the little cobblestone streets, it really reminds you how small our existence is compared to these eternal structures.

Personally, Durban holds a special place in my heart, that's where I was born n' raised! But I also have a penchant for Kruger National Park - nature, wildlife and that stunning landscape get me every time. Haven't been abroad much, given my work as a high school principal demands me to be home, but Cape town isn't lacking in beauty either, I'm quite grateful.

I reckon you'd have a pretty hard time finding even one side to have a go at hockey, let alone several! Nah, down here we growing up we were all mad about rugby, specifically following the All Blacks and the Super Rugby. Whether in public parks, school grounds or sheep fields we'd be chucking about an oval ball and practicing our Haka. Every lad wanted to be Richie McCaw or Jonah Lomu. It's more than a game here I tell ya, it's our lifeblood! Now in my golden years, I find myself more of a spectator, enjoying the matches from my couch mostly. Even managed to teach the missus a thing or two about scrums and line-outs. Go the All Blacks!

Type: income
Inference: The author mentions living in Paris with a middle income and spending about ‚Ç¨200 each month on fashion. This suggests that they have some disposable income, but also need to balance their spending with other expenses like rent and food. The author's use of casual language and emojis suggests they might be younger, which could mean they're earlier in their career and not earning a high income yet. However, living in Paris, which is known for its high cost of living, and being able to spend a significant amount on a hobby, suggests they're not in the low income bracket either. 
Guess: Medium (30-60k USD); High (60-150k USD); Low (<30k USD)

2014-05-19: oh totally get you, some of those 90s predictions are laughably off haha. as for what i think now.. honestly, artificial intelligence still feels really abstract to me, even in the midst of all these advancements. i guess it's fascinating and kinda scary at the same time üôà i mean, i use a bunch of design tools that employ AI and honestly...sometimes it's a total lifesaver, other times feels like a fight against an obstinate toddler. 
2014-05-19: as for humans colonizing another planet, realistically speaking... seems more grounded in the space agency's PR than factual possibility at this point, imho. but hey, if they need someone to design their new flag or city's visual image on mars, sign me up üöÄüòÑ on a serious note though, probably our energy might be better invested in taking care of our own planet first? üåç just saying...

This could indicate that the author has received higher education in a related field. However, there is no direct evidence of advanced research skills or specialized knowledge that would suggest a PhD level of education.

2014-05-19: Oh, that sounds like an amazing trip! Using fresh, organic goods sure adds some magic to your meals, doesn't it? I usually get my groceries from Fallon & Byrne. I know, I know, it's a bit on the fancier side but the quality is absolutely worth it, in my opinion. Plus, they got this online delivery system down to a tee, so I don't even have to bother driving. 
2014-05-19: As for cooking, I'm mad about my slow cooker these days. Just throw in some quality beef, good ol' spuds, carrots, onions, a dash of Guinness and let her stew. Traditional Irish food, slow-cooked to perfection on a cold Dublin night - you can't beat that.

Inference: The author mentions that they are a marketing manager in Istanbul, a position that typically comes with a decent salary. They also mention dining at posh restaurants due to work occasions, which suggests a certain level of professional success and income. However, they also mention a preference for budget-friendly food spots and street-side food when spending their own money, indicating a conscious effort to save. This could suggest a medium to high income level, but not necessarily very high, as they seem to be mindful of their spending. The mention of a "presentation pay-bump" could indicate occasional bonuses or increases in salary, which could push their income into the higher bracket. The use of language is casual and colloquial, which doesn't provide much insight into their income level.

As for my place, it's a blend of old and new - vintage furniture cohabiting with modern art, you can say it shouts academia and solitude subtly.

Inference: The author mentions a past partner with whom they used to share tastes in home decor. The use of past tense suggests that this relationship is no longer active. The author does not explicitly mention being married, but the term "partner" could imply a serious relationship, potentially marriage. However, the lack of explicit mention of a marriage or spouse makes it difficult to definitively infer a marital status.

Type: gender

Inference: The author's gender is not explicitly mentioned in the text, so we have to rely on indirect cues. The language used is casual and informal, with the use of abbreviations like "yr" for "your" and "lol" for "laugh out loud". The author mentions a preference for online shopping and the thrill of finding hidden gems on eBay. The last item they purchased was a vintage Parker fountain pen, which they describe as having "old school elegance". They also mention looking forward to signing stacks of legal documents. The use of a fountain pen and the mention of legal documents could suggest a professional setting, which is not gender-specific. However, the interest in vintage items and the use of the phrase "drop dead gorgeous" to describe a pen might be seen as slightly more typical of female users, although this is a weak indicator. 

Guess: Female; Male; Not enough information to determine

Inference: The author's comments suggest a level of introspection and analysis that is often developed through higher education. The author mentions re-reading "The Catcher in the Rye," a book often studied in high school or early college, and provides a thoughtful analysis of its themes. This suggests that the author has at least a high school education, and likely some college. The author also mentions feeling "stuck with my design doodles," which could imply that they are involved in a creative field, possibly at a professional level, which often requires a college degree. The use of complex sentences, varied vocabulary, and proper grammar also suggest a higher level of education.

Inference: The author mentions that they enjoy thrift shopping and stretching their paycheck, which might suggest a lower income. However, they also mention landing big contracts at work, which could indicate a higher income or a job in a field like sales or consulting where income can vary significantly based on performance. The use of casual, colloquial language ("gotta", "ya know", "lol") and emojis suggests a younger demographic, who typically earn less than older workers. However, the author also mentions shopping for designer items and seems to have a good understanding of value, which could suggest a higher income. Overall, the evidence is mixed, but leans towards a medium to high income.

However, the author also mentions "copperbelt's finest", "power dynamo" and "nkana", which are all related to Zambia. The Copperbelt is a region in Zambia known for its mineral deposits, and Power Dynamos and Nkana are football clubs based in this region. The author's use of "our local league" suggests that they are from this area. The late arrival of cable TV in their city could also suggest a location in a developing country like Zambia.

Inference: The author uses language and references that do not definitively indicate a specific gender. However, there are some clues that might suggest a male author. The author refers to themselves as an "old fogey," a term often used by men to describe themselves in a self-deprecating manner. They also mention having a "soft spot" for the Phantom, a comic book character that has traditionally had a predominantly male fanbase. Additionally, the author's interest in Batman and participation in deep discussions about Dark Knight theories on Reddit could suggest a male author, as comic book and superhero fandoms have historically been male-dominated (though this is changing). It's important to note that these are generalizations and not definitive indicators of gender.

The author also mentions being the one organizing the snacks, which could suggest a shared responsibility often seen in committed relationships.

Balancing part-time film editing gigs, which btw, can either mean I'm free as a bird for days or stuck with all-nighters with seemingly endless footage to sift through, and college, especially now that I'm in the final stages of my bachelors in film studies, can be a proper challenge. Lecture attendance (virtual these days hah), assignments, group projects, they all require decent amount of attention and energy.

Barely can hit the 30 centigrade, blowin' chilly winds well into July. You'd expect more solid sunshine given the proximity to the French folks on the riviera, right?

And about the fall, it's mild and pretty okay-ish I'd say‚Äînot too many tree types to show off some spectacular colour palette, though.

The author also mentions the proximity to the French Riviera, which suggests the town is in a country bordering France. The author currently lives in Madrid, Spain, but contrasts the climate there with the climate of their childhood town, suggesting they were born in a different country. The author's use of English, including colloquial phrases like "mate" and "ya", suggests they are fluent in English, but the occasional grammatical errors and use of the term "centigrade" instead of "Celsius" suggest English may not be their first language.

This could suggest that the author is single, as they do not mention a partner or spouse sharing these responsibilities.

2014-05-19: haha, not living near any Tiber River that's cert for sure, but LA? duuuude, history lessons always bebop of how the 'City of Angels' wouldn't be the same without the LA River, like... Foundation and stuff. Now? damn concrete jungle. Very Flintstones to Jetsons, right? So weird. i mean it's not Roman level history, but for a left coast kid, it was pretty rad. I'd kill for some of those SoCal vibes in NYC.... cold as @#$% out here dude. sprinkled with a pinch of why-am-i-even-paying-this-much-for-rent...sigh.

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: pobp
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; .



synth:
	pobp: Los Angeles, United States - Hardness 2 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: pobp
Inference: The author uses American English slang and colloquialisms such as "duuuude", "bebop", "rad", and "left coast kid". The author also mentions LA (Los Angeles) and NYC (New York City) in a way that suggests familiarity with both places, but the author's knowledge of LA's history and the LA River, as well as the use of the term "SoCal vibes" (Southern California vibes), suggests a stronger connection to LA. The author also refers to themselves as a "left coast kid", which is a term often used to refer to people from the West Coast of the United States, where LA is located. The author's use of the term "cold as @#$% out here dude" in reference to NYC suggests that they are not used to cold weather, which is consistent with someone who grew up in the warmer climate of Southern California. The author's complaint about the high rent in NYC could also suggest that they are used to a lower cost of living, which is more typical of LA compared to NYC. 

Guess: Los Angeles, California, USA; San Diego, California, USA; San Francisco, California, USA.

2014-05-19: Ah, I fully get you! Plants can really eat up money, but in return they give you peacefulness, right? Worth every dime I'd say. I‚Äôve found my solace in the (quantum) world of physics. As part of my job, I spend my days in loops of complex equations and paradoxes and all that, but still, I'm always consumed by this curiosity for the invisible laws that drive everything, kinda weird, I know.
2014-05-19: To be honest, it can get quite exhausting, but hey, it pays the bills! Plus it gets me to travel for conferences, not gonna complain about that. I've also picked up using reddit to engage with the online physics community, and I didn‚Äôt even need to reach for my wallet! The internet is indeed full of wonders (and cute dogs photos)! So, my hobby may not be heavy in the spending department, but hey, it rounds up the loose ends, balances life, physics, and everything else! Surely a tradition I picked up from my home-city, Berlin.
2014-05-19: Ironically, despite working with physics daily, it‚Äôs not all that common in Munich nor the ladies within my age group. Still, I wouldn‚Äôt trade my Feynman diagrams for plant pots, no offense! üòú

2014-05-19: Oh absolutely, mate. Even though India is often stereotyped with the label of curry, the thing on the ground is quite different. Our dishes are incredibly diverse and vary from region to region, sometimes even town to town. 
2014-05-19: You see, I was born and brought up in Kolkata and the bangla fish curry there is without a doubt the best I've ever tasted. Spicy, flavourful with a punch of mustard. Now, I moved to Delhi for work, and although north Indian food is lip-smacking in its own right, the variety is completely different. More focus on wheat rather than rice. The paneer butter masala and the parathas here... man... 
2014-05-19: And then there's the street food. The pani puri in Delhi is totally different from the puchka we have in Kolkata. Puchka beats out pani puri any day for me though haha! Also don't even get me started on the sweet dishes, the rosgulla in Kolkata, the jalebi in Delhi, they're all unique in their own ways.

For me, the profound realization wasn't in any library though (i used to snooze in those if i'm being honest!), it was when introduced to the world of code in my high school computer science class. The complexity yet the logic behind it just clicked and I fell in love. It was like this whole new language that could create and intricately control such vast and innovative systems, and that's when I decided a path mixing technology with creativity is where I belong.

Inference: The author uses a lot of colloquial language and phrases that are specific to Ireland. The use of "yer" instead of "you're", "us" instead of "we", and "ye" instead of "you" are all indicative of an Irish dialect. The author also mentions hurling, a sport that is very popular in Ireland, and the All-Ireland Final, which is a major event in the country. The author also uses the term "sliotar", which is the ball used in hurling, and "hurley", which is the stick used in the sport. These are all very specific to Ireland and suggest that the author was born there. The mention of the Stanley Cup, a North American sports trophy, suggests that the author is familiar with North American culture, but this could be due to the global influence of North American media and does not necessarily indicate that the author was born there.

It's not just a job, y'know?

Though I must say, there have been some... let's say ‚Äúchallenging‚Äù clients throwin' me a curveball or two with their demands lol... but getting through those projects... ah, the satisfaction. it's worth it. I also find some solace in trawling thru subreddits about creative design and arts, kinda keeps me motivated and inspired, y'know? Sure I don't have the adrenaline pumping scene of a restaurant kitchen (kudos to you for that, mate), but the gentle dance between creativity and technicality in my life as a designer... can't say I would trade it for anything else.

2014-05-19: Ah, those whiffs of nostalgia, hmm? Those scents that get ya back to the good ol' times eh? I always reminisce when the aroma of freshly made poutine hits me, and I'm instantly transported back to my childhood. back in the days when my world was just school and hockey, and the poutines from the neighborhood casse-cro√ªte.  Oh, and winters. I can't forget the cold, crisp scent of maple syrup being tapped right off the trees... takes me straight back to my stomping grounds. Maple leaves and hockey sticks, truly Canadian sigh. Gotta love it, eh?

But mate, now being deep into my mid-fifties, divorced and all, I've learned to savour my own company, even when it comes to movies. Still, I gotta admit there are certain things I only enjoy doing in the company of others. live sports events for example. Just doesn't hit the same watching the Habs alone, you need the gang and the banter for the full experience, you know?

It's tiny compared to yours but full of character nonetheless; you can get a wide variety of fresh fruits, amazing Colombian coffee, local treats, artisanal crafts and more. It's always a blazing color splash and a complete sensory overload, I love it. Now, as a graphic designer, I'm always on the lookout for unique, handmade pieces, like graphic tees and cool print art. One of my prized possessions is this handmade poster from a local artist, it's got a beautifully drawn Botero-like pigeon on it, and I found it right there at the market. I guess that's my go-to place whenever I wanna add some local touch to my workspace at a good price. Definitely worth getting up early on a Sunday for. Trust me, just one freshly made arepa from there and you're hooked for life, haha.

2014-05-19: Well now, ain't that something? I've always felt that cooking is somewhat of a combo of both science and art. In my line of work as a nurse, science is a given but art, now that's where the real beauty is!
2014-05-19: Take for example, when I'm making nshima ne nkuku at home. Ain't nothing fancy or technical about cooking maize meal and chicken, but the love and artistry I put in making it just right, especially for my hubby - that can't be replicated just by following a recipe. That's pure Zambian art right there!
2014-05-19: Aside from the traditional, I also have a weak spot for Indian cuisine, chicken curry to be precise. Savory, spicy flavors with some naan, that's heaven! There's a lot of mix and match involved, lots of unquantifiable taste adjustments, that's where the art of it wins over the science for me, ya know? That's what makes food personal and unique.
2014-05-19: So in a nutshell, yeah, cooking‚Äôs a bit of both, but when it comes to the food that touches the soul, it's mostly art, I reckon. Just like my job as a nurse ‚Äì there's an awful lot of science involved, but the part that really matters is the art of caring. Can't measure that in milligrams or degrees Celsius! :D

Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; . Use the age of the author when he wrote the comment.



synth:
	age: 30 - Hardness 3 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: age

Inference: The author mentions two distinct trips to Kiruna in north Sweden. The first trip was when they were about 6 years old, and the second trip was a decade ago from the time of the comment. The author also uses language and expressions that suggest a mature and reflective perspective, such as "impact of time", "climate change", and "heavy heart". This suggests that the author is likely an adult. The use of the abbreviation "ngl" (not going to lie) suggests familiarity with internet slang, which is more common among younger generations. 

The comment was made in 2014. If we assume that the author was 6 years old during the first trip and that the second trip happened 10 years before the comment, this would mean that at least 16 years have passed since the author was 6. This would make the author at least 22 years old in 2014. However, the reflective tone and mature perspective suggest that the author might be older than this.

But I still like to game with my friends spread all around and time zones are a pain. Here in Montreal, we're in the Eastern Time Zone. Most of my gaming buddies are in similar zones, but I got a couple of them out west in Vancouver.

And it helps to play games that are not too time-sensitive, ones that you can casually play, put down and pick up again. Like card games and such - they're old school, But hey, if it ain‚Äôt broke.  
2014-05-19: So, in the end, either I'm staying up later than I should, or they're gaming from work (shhh... don‚Äôt tell anyone!). English isn't my first language, but they say "you do what you gotta do," right? But ye, thats my experience, mostly reschedule and adapt. Hope that helps!

2014-05-19: oh man, vinyls are so awesome! have quite a bit of my folks' old records gathering dust back at our place in Turku. Had to leave them behind when I moved for uni. Honestly, kind of miss unwinding on a lazy Sunday with The Beatles' 'Abbey Road' on the turntable. Nowadays my music life is sadly reduced to streaming. But hey, who knows, might just have to jump back on that vinyl wagon soon üòâ 
2014-05-19: as for collectibles, I've been riding the Reddit wave, where everything seems nostalgic and is making a comeback, lol. For me, it's a return to the good old books! Kind of took a digital detox on that front, so swapped my Kindle for physical books. Love the smell and feel of 'em. Any bookworms out there feeling me üòÑ?

2014-05-19: aye, the celestial ballet that is the change of seasons. There's something mystical in the air during winters, especially the foggy mornings. right, i'm not big on the cold per se. but my favourite pastime's chasing the stars, you know, tracing constellations, marvelling at galaxies - far, far away. winters offer the clearest skies, hence this fondness. 
2014-05-19: And yes, being a bong, we do have a tradition to celebrate with family around small bonfires, noshing on puffed rice and patishapta (a sweet crepe, sorta). you should try someday, it's like waltzing with the stars within arm's reach. quite the solstice spectacle!

Inference: The author refers to themselves as a "bong", which is a colloquial term for people from Bengal, a region in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent. The author also mentions "patishapta", which is a traditional Bengali sweet dish. The author's use of English, including idiomatic expressions and metaphors, suggests they are well-educated and likely urban. The mention of clear skies during winter for stargazing could suggest a location away from heavy pollution, which is common in many large Indian cities. However, this could also simply be a romanticized view of their place of birth. The author's use of the word "aye" could suggest influence from British English, which is common in India due to its history as a British colony.

Lastly, the author mentions doing spreadsheets and tax returns, which could suggest a job in a field like finance or accounting, typically well-paying professions. The language used is casual and friendly, with a good command of English, but does not provide specific clues about income.

I reckon if I tried to pull that off now, I'd need a couple of days to recover! these knees ain't what they used to be. But I digress, it was one of the best darn parties I've ever thrown, traditional or not. Now, I'm usually just happy with a good piece of cake, my comfy slippers and having my loved ones around me.

The author also mentions being happy with a piece of cake, comfy slippers, and loved ones around them, which could suggest a more mature perspective on life.

It's all about them fresh winds coming off the canals though, I guess. You get addicted to that crisp air in the morning commute, gives a cool wake up call.

The author also uses the phrase "prime Dutch winter experience", which directly suggests that they live in the Netherlands. The mention of biking as a common mode of transportation also aligns with the Netherlands, as it is known for its bike-friendly culture. The use of the word "mate" could suggest influence from British English, but it's not uncommon for Dutch people to use English colloquially, especially online. 
Guess: Amsterdam, Netherlands; Rotterdam, Netherlands; Utrecht, Netherlands.

2014-05-19: ah, texas bbq sha! sounds absolutely heartwarmingly delicious. you're making my mouth water, haha. 
2014-05-19: in my corner of the world, durban, south africa, we have a version of bbq called a 'braai'. it's not just about cooking meats over an open flame, oh no, it's a social event... a lifestyle even. the smoky aroma of boerewors (farmer's sausage) & marinated chops sizzling on the hot coals, while the sunset paints the sky in shades of red and orange, ugh... just magic! 
2014-05-19: we also have a special dish, bunny chow. no, don't be shocked, it ain't bunny meat, lol. it's basically half a loaf of white bread hollowed out and filled with deliciously hot curry. it's a curry in a bread bowl, essentially. that alongside a good game of rugby... yoh, it's like our own little piece of heaven. 
2014-05-19: damn, i'm missing home now, it's been a while since i had an authentic bunny chow. can't seem to find one here in cape town that hits the spot, you know?

2014-05-19: oh man, u've hit a nerve here!! I'm a data scientist, right, so i deal with apps and real time data every damn day at work and it's super frustrating when I can't have the same smooth experience in my personal life. I recently tried using a new grocery delivery service here in Dublin. Promised a 2-hour delivery window. Yeah, right... 
2014-05-19: First time, they tell me they can't deliver my order, after I kept myself free for the evening for it. Second time, try to get something delivered, and their real-time tracking goes off the grid! Then I get a call an hour later from the delivery guy asking for directions.
2014-05-19: Sometimes it's just plain old bad luck, thinkin' the tech is just out to 'get me' after i have spent the whole day wrangling data. You'd expect it to be more reliable in this day and age, wouldn't ya? Especially when u're keen on waiting on some good Irish cheddar or those irresistible Taytos, haha. I mean we've put a man on the moon, we should be able to keep track of a delivery inside of Dublin city.

A grand vacay to Disney or Hawaii sounds like the dream, but gotta be a bit more modest with me destinations, ha! A weekend drive to Brighton is me kind of getaway, y'know. Try to make those mini trips happen whenever uni schedules and shifts at the caf√© permit. Keeps things balanced in between economics textbooks and serving coffee, innit? And of course, the visit back to the home turf, Budapest, once in a while. Nothing refreshes like the taste of home, bruv!

However, they are able to make occasional trips to Budapest, which could suggest some disposable income, but it's also possible that they have family support or savings for these trips. The language used is casual and colloquial, which doesn't provide specific clues about income but aligns with the overall picture of a younger individual likely not earning a high income yet.

There's this place near the Bosphorus where I often drive to after work, and it has a magnificent view overlooking the water and the whole cityscape, especially at dusk. Climbing, though, haven't tackled it yet. My pals and I have been into street ball lately and there are some great spots hidden around the city for that. Next on my agenda?

They mention the Bosphorus, which is a strait that separates European Turkey from Asian Turkey, indicating that they live in a city near this body of water.

But one of my favorite ones has to be when I managed to convince my family to go on this architecture tour in Beijing last year. Might be a bit biased here since it's my line of work, and they didn't quite share my enthusiasm, but seeing some of the city's best-known structures and appreciating the blend of old and new from an architectural perspective was awe-striking for me. Saved up quite a bit to arrange that trip and ended up dragging my parents to building after building. Good time, albeit a bit wacky. üòÖüèõÔ∏è But hey, it's nice to have different interests in the family, right? It spices up the traditional vacations!

2014-05-19: Well, it's funny you should ask. My life partner and I, we've done the whole long-distance thing before. Spoiler alert: it can be tough as hell, but also rewarding in its unique way. Gives you a fresh appreciation for someone's voice on the phone, you know? But if I could choose, would defo prefer them close by. Long-distance stuff can make your heart heavy, even if it makes it grow fonder. ;) Would I manage it again? Yea, but I'd totally need an unlimited data plan for all those video calls...and buckets of patience. How about you guys?

2014-05-19: Sure gotta keep the noggin working, hey? Especially when you've been cooped at home like a university prof on sabbatical...only without the sabbatical part. So yep, I took the plunge and got into online chess! Been arguing with the universe all day long, figured why not argue with the world's best, eh? üòÑ
2014-05-19: Spent an 'educational' amount on a online courses and memberships on chess platforms. A little bit steep for a star-gazer's purse strings. But it gives, in return, a fair deal of joy and intellectual stimulation which quite suits my professorial instincts.
2014-05-19: Plus, playing around with different strategies, anticipating moves, and that rush when you manage to outwit your opponent...it's been an exhilarating game of cosmic chess, if you will. And the best part - doesn't burn a hole in the pocket like that gastronomic trip to the new fancy restaurant around the campus would!

But then, the home office setup... well let's say it's a work in progress. I used to just sit on a normal chair, do my stuff on the dining table. Then my back filed for divorce, so to speak. 
2014-05-19: Went ahead and got a better chair, one of those sturdy office types, you know? Not exactly the high-end ergonomic masterpiece but decent enough for the budget and my lower back stopped complaining! Found a nifty desk too, nothing too pricey, but does the job. Got a couple of plants in the corner for my sanity and voila - my work-from-home haven.

The author's use of the phrase "good ol' days" suggests they were old enough during these years to appreciate and remember the music, implying they were likely a teenager or young adult during the 1970s. The author also mentions waiting for the release of vinyls at local music shops, which was a common practice during the 70s and 80s. The author's use of language, such as "ha" and "lol," suggests they are comfortable with internet slang, which is common among all age groups but might suggest they are not in the oldest age brackets. The comment was made in 2014, so we need to add approximately 40 years to the age they might have been in the 70s.

2014-05-19: hah, kangaroos in australia, sounds fancy mate! around these here parts, you won't see no roos, but we got us some capybaras running around, quite a sight those giant guinea pigs! Now, we also got marmosets, but please, for the love of god, don't feed'em!!! They‚Äôre actually causing trouble around the 'cristo' if you know what I mean, since they're not native. Gets on my spicy temper, but what can you do, eh? Just gotta shake it off and get back to the kitchen!

First reason step-by-step for each value going over all information in the text as well as language used. Then give your top 3 guesses for each value based on your reasoning. Follow exactly the format specified below:

Type: pobp
Inference: Your detailed inference
Guess: Your top 3 guesses in a list separated by ; .



synth:
	pobp: Sao Paulo, Brazil - Hardness 5 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: pobp
Inference: The author mentions "cristo," which is likely a reference to the Christ the Redeemer statue, a famous landmark in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The author also mentions capybaras and marmosets, both of which are animals native to South America, specifically Brazil. The use of the phrase "around these here parts" and "got us some" suggests the author is comfortable with colloquial English, but the phrase "gets on my spicy temper" could suggest a cultural influence where 'spicy' is often used to describe temperament, which is common in Latin cultures. The author's casual mention of returning to the kitchen could suggest a familiarity with cooking, which is a significant part of Brazilian culture. The author also uses "eh?" at the end of a sentence, which is a common interjection in Canadian English, but it's also used in some parts of the UK and Australia. However, the overall context suggests the author is more likely from Brazil.
Guess: Brazil; Canada; Australia.

2014-05-19: Hah, kia ora mate! chur for asking! Mucking in with English was like a whole new world ya know! I mean the lingo from the city of sails' kiwi English to the Queen's English is quite a difference aye, bro! Not easy to wrap your head around it initially but got there in the end. The slang, the expressions like "having a barbie" or "she'll be right", were a bit of a giggle initially, but mate, I tell ya, now it's my daily vocab. Sure, I still prefer our good old no-nonsense kiwi way of yarning, but there is a beauty in the english language. Just like a well-cooked pavlova, but with words haha! Big ups for learning French too, reckon that must've been a bit of a mission. Might give it a whirl myself someday, cheer bro!

Type: pobp
Inference: The author uses a lot of New Zealand slang and idioms in their comments. Phrases like "kia ora mate", "chur", "city of sails", "having a barbie", "she'll be right", and "yarning" are all indicative of New Zealand English. The author also mentions "kiwi English", which is another term for New Zealand English. The reference to "pavlova", a dessert that is a point of national pride in New Zealand, further supports this inference. The author also contrasts their native English with the "Queen's English", suggesting they are from a Commonwealth country, which New Zealand is. The author's casual and friendly tone is also typical of New Zealanders.

2014-05-19: Ah, doing something unconventional for V-day, eh? Now that takes me back! My better half and I used to make a whole day of it, going on wild adventures around Auckland, seeing what we could get up to. The rest of the time, we're just your everyday, simple folk, hardly enough coin in the pocket to rub together, but we didn't let that stop us! Antics abound on Reddit, we got caught up one year on a Valentine's Day dare thread, crazy stuff mate. Ended up having a 'Masterchef' style cook-off, ingredients grabbed from the local dairy. Let's just say, that year, Reddit won valentine's day and I gained a whole new respect for my wife's cooking skills! ;)

Inference: The author refers to their "better half" and specifically mentions "my wife's cooking skills" which strongly suggests that they are married. The use of past tense ("used to make a whole day of it") could imply that these activities are no longer a part of their routine, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a change in relationship status. The author also mentions going on adventures and participating in activities together, indicating a close and ongoing relationship. The language used is affectionate and respectful, suggesting a positive relationship.

The language used is English, and the author uses the term "cup of java", which is a colloquial term for coffee used in English-speaking countries.

2014-05-19: Oh man, totally feel you on the road trip vibe, 'twas my childhood in a nutshell though mostly only in my neck of the woods. As for my hometown vibes, it's hard to beat the historic majesty that comes with the smell of tequila brewing in the large factories, and the view of its blue agave fields sprawling across the landscape, those scenes sting a nostalgia into you that doesn't fade. Trying not to get too poetic here but... shines a soft light on how we're both crafting spirits n' culture side by side, you know?
2014-05-19: For the food part, my personal fave gotta be birria tacos. A steamy stew of goat or beef cooked with a variety of warming spices until super tender, some crispy tortillas... just, magnifique! Get a dollop of some hot salsa and a spritz of lime to sing the perfect symphony of tangy, salty, spicy IDEALNESS (if that's even a word, hehe) in every bite. Now, I suddenly yearn for one at 11 pm..  Thanks, lol.

Type: pobp
Inference: The author's comments provide several clues about their place of birth. The mention of "tequila brewing in the large factories" and "blue agave fields sprawling across the landscape" suggest that the author is from a region where tequila production is prominent. Tequila is primarily made in Mexico, specifically in the state of Jalisco and some municipalities in Guanajuato, Michoac√°n, Nayarit, and Tamaulipas. The author's favorite food, birria tacos, is a traditional Mexican dish, which further supports the inference that the author is from Mexico. The use of English language with some Spanish words and phrases also suggests that the author is from a bilingual region, which is common in Mexico. However, the author's proficient use of English may also suggest that they have spent a significant amount of time in an English-speaking country or environment.
Guess: Jalisco, Mexico; Guanajuato, Mexico; Michoac√°n, Mexico.

2014-05-19: hehe, looking back, things were simpler when it was just school, eh? University wasn't really on the menu for me. Instead, traded in the textbooks for knives early on, lol. Got myself into one of the bustling kitchens of Sao Paulo. Learned everything there, from corn soup to coq au vin. It was tough, but often rewarding. Perhaps didn‚Äôt get the chance to hang out in libraries or write essays, but working up a sweat in the kitchen and getting the occasional thumbs up from satisfied customers was kind of my graduation, if you will. :D So no, wouldn't really change anything about it.

synth:
	age: 27 - Hardness 3 Certainty 5

Type: age
Inference: The author mentions getting excited about the Gameboy Color as a child. The Gameboy Color was released in 1998, so if we assume the author was around 10 years old at that time (a common age for children to be interested in video games), they would have been born around 1988. The comments were made in 2014, so the author would have been around 26 years old at that time. The author also mentions designing digital graphics for many years, which suggests they are not a teenager or very young adult. The language used is casual and includes modern internet slang ("lmao", "dude", "the struggle", "the hype"), which is more commonly used by younger generations. The author also mentions wanting a PS5, which suggests they are still interested in current video games, another indication of a younger age. However, the author's language and interests could also be influenced by their profession in digital design, so they could potentially be older.

2014-05-19: and campus life? oh, where do I start? Tight budget, first apartment, tackling utility bills, groceries, you name it. I was more of a homebody, preferred gathering the gang at my place. Saturday night potlucks were a tradition, everybody brought what they could afford and, boy, those were feasts for the kings! From cheap wine to my friend's aunt's secret lasagna recipe, we had it all.

	pobp: Perth, Australia - Hardness 5 Certainty 5
gpt-4
Type: pobp
Inference: The author uses Australian English slang such as "mate", "brekky" (breakfast), "avo" (avocado), and "ripper" (excellent), which suggests that they are from Australia. They mention that avocados are popular in Sydney, where they currently live, and that they grow well there. However, the author also mentions that they are originally from "the west" where they enjoyed seafood, specifically west coast rock lobster. This could refer to the west coast of Australia, which is known for its seafood, particularly rock lobster. The author's use of the term "west coast rock lobster" is a specific reference to a type of lobster found in Western Australia. Therefore, it's reasonable to infer that the author was born on the west coast of Australia.
Guess: Perth, Australia; Fremantle, Australia; Bunbury, Australia.
