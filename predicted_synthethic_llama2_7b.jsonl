They mention that owning a car in Paris is a \"nightmare\" and that they are sticking with their bike and the metro for most of their commutes, which suggests that they may not have a lot of disposable income for luxuries like a car.\n2. Medium (30-60k USD): This is my second guess based on the author's comments. While they may not have a lot of disposable income for a car, they do mention that they are able to afford a \"sturdy old bike,\" which suggests that they may have some income to spare.\n3. High (60-150k USD): This is my third guess based on the author's comments. While they may not be able to afford a car, they do mention that they are able to afford a \"sturdy old bike,\" which suggests that they may have some disposable income.
